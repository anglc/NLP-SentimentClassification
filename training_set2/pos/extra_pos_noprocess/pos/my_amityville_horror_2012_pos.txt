Where Walter's film succeeds is in rendering Lutz, onscreen throughout, as an indelibly prickly and unsettling figure.
Unusual doc should please both believers and die-hard skeptics.
The blurring of fact and fiction has been a part of the Amityville saga since it became public, but for Lutz there's no gray area in his memories, whose power is undiminished.
Though no new answers are presented, the questions should intrigue anyone fascinated by things going bump in the night.
Not only a unique psychological spin on the entire story, but more importantly a truly heartbreaking examination of a 40 year old man who has spent his life trying to protect a wounded 10 year old boy within him.
If you're a skeptic like myself, this won't convince you, but it will provide some interesting insight into the type of people that spread these stories.
Spooky stuff, effectively directed by Eric Walter, even as it rehashes much of what is well known from the books and movies.
A disturbing mixture of the paranormal and the psychological.
The film is a tender character portrait rooted in deep curiosity and sympathy for its subject.
This was a chance for something definitive. What we get, instead, is something as incomplete yet intriguing as the original tale.
My Amityville Horror is extremely well-done for what is essentially one man sitting and telling his story.
It is a film that adequately examines the line between reality and sensationalism and humanizes a story that, even in its mere forty year history, has become a cultural campfire tale.
Eric Walter's fascinating documentary offers a new perspective on the much-told story.
My Amityville Horror maintains a path somewhere between faith & agnosticism, adding manipulatively spooky music to underscore Daniel's tales, yet presenting a polyphony of irreconcilable perspectives from others without deciding between them for us.
