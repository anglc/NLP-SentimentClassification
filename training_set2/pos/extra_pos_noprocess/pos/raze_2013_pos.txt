"Raze" is a sweaty, queasy, bruising experience - and a superbly crafted film.
If you can stand to watch this movie -- a big if -- there is food for thought here about the subjugation and exploitation of women, the limits of psychological and physical endurance, and more.
As violent as it is, Raze is refreshing.
Raze is strong stuff, but also briskly paced and interested in the psychological ramifications of such unrelenting brutality.
For an exploitation movie about girls beating each other to death, 'Raze' doesn't want you to have a lot of fun.
Fight Club looks tame and rather cheery compared to the hellish scenario Raze thrusts Bell and a number of other warrior women into.
If "Raze" had been released in 1975, Quentin Tarantino would never shut up about it.
