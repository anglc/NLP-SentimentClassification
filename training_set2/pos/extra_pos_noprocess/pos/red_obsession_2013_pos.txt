Despite being a rather thin, by-the-books documentary that abruptly changes course at the halfway mark, Red Obsession tells a fascinating financial tale about the rise of "wine fever" in China.
"Red Obsession" gains interest as it delineates how the production and sale of first-growth Bordeaux has become the biggest of businesses and how the Chinese may or may not fit into the picture.
The movie raises legitimate concerns about the cultural and economic implications of status-minded overconsumption.
[a] probing, fascinating documentary
A concise portrait of not only the historic Bordeaux region of France, but also of the way its business has been impacted-for good and ill-by China's emergence as a superpower.
The doc affords us a look into a world rarely seen by the lumpenproletariat ...
Wine documentary examines China's consumption's contribution to runaway prices.
Sly, sometimes funny documentary version of Bottle Shock, with China playing the role of 1970s Napa as it creeps up to smack the snooty Old World wine snobs.
This exceptional, visually and informationally rich doc reveals much beyond its ostensible theme.
A film about obsession, about wine-mania, about people who live, breathe, eat, think, drink wine.
Red Obsession is informative, and entertainingly so, with its honeyed Russell Crowe narration and sweet tracking shots through sun-dappled vineyards.
Offers the ins and outs of the world of wine as an implicit metaphor for art appreciation, from both aesthetic and financial standpoints.
The film isn't so much about wine but about the unstoppable rise of China as the world's next pace-setter...A very entertaining doc, regardless of whether you like a drop.
As much an examination of contemporary Chinese character, ambition and taste as it is of the Chateaux and wines of Bordeaux ... globe-trotting, hugely informative and thoroughly entertaining ... crafted with as much care as the wines we see onscreen.
The film, which premiered at Robert De Niro's Tribeca Film Festival in New York, proves remarkably enlightening.
There isn't a wine writer or wine maker of note who doesn't get a say about the traditional prestige of Bordeaux wines, especially the almighty Lafite and Margaux labels
Like a fine wine whose pleasures go far beyond its bouquet, the winding journey of this Australian co-production (with France, UK, China and Hong Kong) is long and far-reaching
