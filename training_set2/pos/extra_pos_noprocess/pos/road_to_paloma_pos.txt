An effective throwback to the loose-limbed, my-way-or-the-highway road movies of the "Easy Rider" era.
None of this is riveting, but the film's loose naturalism and strong acting - Chris Browning, as a liaison between the F.B.I. and the reservation, is especially enjoyable - are slyly seductive.
Momoa makes much of it work through sheer force of will as Wolf, a chopper-riding Native American hunted by venal lawmen and seeking his mother's killer.
(Director) Momoa progresses through the episodic plot with confident skill, although he may have had a few words with his leading man about easing back on the Rock-like charm (Wolf is murderer on the run, after all).
Gritty, grim and uncompromising, Road to Paloma is an uncommonly thoughtful and thrilling ride, made all the better by Jason Momoa's magnetic screen presence.
Retains a rich cinematic personality and satisfying performances, keeping just enough emotion on the front burner to help follow the hunt.
A biker B-movie backed by the WWE, co-written and directed by Jason Momoa, can be a work of art. Seriously.
