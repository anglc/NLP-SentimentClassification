The young married couple does something cruel, and then the idiot frat guys next door respond, and back and forth it goes. I laughed, but not uproariously and not often enough.
As as tensions escalate, Teddy and Peter's partnership proves just as central and perhaps more vulnerable than Mac and Kelly's. Score one for growing up.
Rogen's always a dominating presence, but [Byrne], who showed her comic chops in Bridesmaids, comes close to stealing the movie here, in an uncorked performance full of volatile, liberating mischief.
One of the great surprises of Neighbors is both the gentle way with which it handles a nimrod party animal like Teddy and how good Efron is at playing him.
At least this comedy goes well beyond the bunch of creative revenge ploys that these next-door nemeses wreak on each other. Neighbors isn't straight-As, bring-down-the-house smart-funny, but it's no drop-out, sprawling, lame block party of a flick either.
It operates as a genuinely funny, but not obnoxiously course, mediation on the bumpy and uncertain transition to adulthood.
Even if the story meanders in a predictable direction, it features several inspired comic moments.
Tries to be a cross between "Animal House" and "Old School" but, sadly, is more like a second-rate "Van Wilder" sequel.
Bad Neighbours makes the occasional comedic stumble but thankfully, it has more than enough energy to make it to the finish line.
It's Byrne who's Rogen's partner in crime, and she's the brains behind the operation ... a refreshing change of pace in a genre that usually relegates ladies to the nag role.
Even the snobbiest snobs in Neighbors turn out to be closeted slobs, and it's much funnier as a result.
The good news is that with Neighbors, you get the movie you're promised, and it's funny; the better news is that Neighbors is also so much smarter than that ; its high points far outshine the low ones,
[Rose Byrne] turns in the kind of film-stealing work here that absolutely just *has to* set her on the road to persistent stardom.
Neighbors, the latest of several movies to use that same title, attempts, yet again, to cash in on culture-clash of ordinary folks vs. wild folks.
Actually, while the script is strong -- the episodic structure means everyone can improv away without derailing the overall plot, which is just about the two sides going nuts anyway -- it's the four lead performances that lift this up and over.
The brothers of Delta Psi might be projections of the Rogen character's stress and anxiety, like the killer children in Cronenberg's 'The Brood,' a difference being that the frat bros wield bongs and dildos instead of lethal meat mallets.
