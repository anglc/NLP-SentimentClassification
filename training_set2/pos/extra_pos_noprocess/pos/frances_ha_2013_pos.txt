One of the happiest sights you'll see all summer is a montage of Gerwig running and twirling across Chinatown with David Bowie's "Modern Love" on the soundtrack.
As Frances literally dances her way through the streets of New York, you can't help smiling and knowing she will be OK. She will figure out how to be the adult she was meant to be.
Few films top Woody Allen's Manhattan for capturing New York City's blend of rapture and apprehension. Noah Baumbach's Frances Ha comes close.
Writing with Gerwig, Baumbach has created a fey, sneakily charming generational touchstone on a par with Annie Hall and his own Gen Y col-grad comedy Kicking and Screaming.
In your twenties you decide on the final version of you. Sophie is working on it; Frances is stuck in her crazy, clueless, can't-pay-the-rent stage.
It's a tribute to Gerwig's performance, somehow both clumsy and elegant, that she wins us over despite ourselves, that we come to appreciate her aimlessness in a goal-oriented society ...
Gerwig draws upon her well of previously-demonstrated charisma, her ample capacity for twerpitude refined, honed, elevated.
Sweet without being saccharine and wrenching without being devastating. Frances Ha is a film of many small surprises, but they contain big, satisfying rewards.
Game and not a self-promoting booster, always slightly outside the loop, the title character accepts what is dealt without complaint or anger.
The thoughtfulness and commitment of Gerwig's performance in its shifts from chaotic exuberance to rigorous rehearsal suggest that she is the more interesting artist to watch.
Gerwig superbly incarnates the contradictions of this insecure woman.
It's the mark of a good film when it's so simple you can sum it up in a sentence, and so deep you're still digging into it hours, even days after the credits roll. That's Frances Ha.
Inspired by Gerwig's spontaneity, and scripted to cultivate it, the movie does turn up some occasional stilted line readings here and there, but periodic awkwardness also is shrewdly elemental to its charm.
I found Frances Ha frequently irritating and even cringe-inducing in the moment, yet feel tenderer towards it in retrospect. It's about a specific time in life, when the sudden stampede to self-definition can make people seem cruel, crazy or resentful.
Baumbach's previous films have been insightful and wry without ever really being all that likeable. Gerwig brings a charm and energy to this shared project that makes it, if perhaps not his deepest film, then easily his most fun.
Frances Ha -- both the movie and its heroine -- is graceful, awkward, luminous and hilarious.
Greta Gerwig is perhaps the most interesting of the younger American actresses working in films today, and she's wonderful as Frances in this black and white charmer from director Noah Baumbach.
The infectiously delightful exuberance of Frances that nearly vibrates off the screen is clearly tailor-made for the actress.
Exuberant and disarming.
The gorgeously-made Frances Ha serves as a love letter from director to star; and like all love notes that aren't ours, it's intimate, mawkish and, in some vital way, unknowable.
As she zips from one oddball experience to another, the movie seems to be assuring us that this is what a young person is supposed to do and that Frances will find her thing. Whatever it is.
