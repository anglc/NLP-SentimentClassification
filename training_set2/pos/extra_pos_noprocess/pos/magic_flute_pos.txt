The results are often fascinating (I love the duet of the Armed Men, sung by a chorus of faces animated out of a wall of sandbags), sometimes ludicrous and never boring.
In the end, love triumphs. In this movie, the music triumphs, proving again that a true masterpiece can survive all kinds of meddling.
Apart from a fascination with the hate-spitting mouth and throat of Lyubov Petrova's vocally pyrotechnic Queen of the Night, the visual gimmicks are individually tolerable. But they don't add up to anything particular.
Even though there were moments in The Magic Flute when I wondered if Branagh hadn't truly gone off his rocker, I found its audacity exhilarating.
Like the Beatles' "Yellow Submarine," it's all about the marriage of music and images.
It dwells quite happily somewhere in the no-man's-land between "Perfect" and "Perfectly Enjoyable."
A week is a long time in cinema. Last Friday saw Branagh being all but written off thanks to the ludicrous Sleuth. This week, he's hitting the high notes.
The film is fresh, spectacular and unafraid to be called philistine.
A genial and good-natured production with much spectacle and entertainment to offer, and, like all of Branagh's classical revivals on celluloid, it manages to be high-minded and yet accessible.
Flashes of inspiration but not enough, one suspects, to cause a stampeding horde of cinemagoers to beat down the doors of the Royal Opera House.
It's an impressive undertaking by Branagh but a rather pointless one.
A huge budget allows for spectacular CGI sequences and Branagh concocts some startlingly inspired ways to accompany Mozart's music in visuals.
Branagh's imagery is imaginative and the music lifts you. A neat trick.
Although Branagh has done a good job of toning down the opera's more ridiculous elements, what remains will test even the most willing opera virgin.
