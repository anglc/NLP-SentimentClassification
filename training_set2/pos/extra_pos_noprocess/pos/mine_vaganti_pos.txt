The feel is somewhat cloistered and the pace rarely gets the pulse racing but this is engaging and affecting stuff, handsomely shot and well acted: Ilaria Occhini is a stand-out as the grandmother.
The film is beautifully shot and set in Lecce, in Puglia, so breathtaking scenery is an important character.
It's bright and smart and ultimately surprisingly moving.
Ozpetek could have trimmed some of the sub-plots, but it's broadly amusing (especially when our hero's camp pals pitch up) and the performances are as warm as the southern setting.
Ozpetek takes these men and women as they are, revealing deep emotions in broad strokes. Everyone here is a disappointed misfit, not just the loose cannons in the clan.
A duty-bound son learns the importance of being true to himself in this slick and bittersweet Italian comedy.
This Italian coming-out comedy has a neat central narrative gimmick. Unfortunately, it hasn't got a lot else.
Slickly funny and polished romantic-comedy.
With a fluid and comedic style comes a film that understands its place in Italian society and doesn't expect any less than complete competency from its audience.
With a family like this, who needs enemies?
