On paper, Chomsky and Gondry seem like an eternal mismatch, but these two very smart people share an odd but genuine chemistry ...
What emerges from the chats and the drawings and the animation is an often-fascinating glimpse at both genius and the creative process (itself a kind of genius, after all). If it sounds boring, it isn't. If it sounds weird, it is - but weird in a good way.
Tthe onscreen result is a striking inquiry into how we comprehend the world, neatly divided between a man of words and a man of images
An almost entirely hand-drawn, animated film that was clearly a labor of love for the director and has enough charm to reach a wider audience than his other recent docs.
Weaves between clear representations of what's discussed and beautiful abstract expressionism.
I only wished the well-meaning documentary would have been less cutesy and opened up more doors into Chomsky's progressive thinking.
Some of the film's best and most revealing moments see Gondry trying to get a slightly wary Chomsky to leave his comfort zone of cerebral conjecture and open up about his emotional life.
Is the Man Who Is Tall Happy? is Michel Gondry's intellectual spirit quest.
A dizzyingly attractive film that breaks down Noam Chomsky's ideas, filters them through Michel Gondry's unique way of seeing, and in the process breaks down the differences between art, science and philosophy
In the nicest possible way, this is teacher-and-pupil stuff.
What's amazing here is how well [Gondry's] stylistically primitive but in fact visually sophisticated drawings clarify Chomsky's sometimes confounding prattle.
A creative look inside the mind of a linguist
The combination of Gondry's whimsicality and Chomsky's stoicism creates fascinating oil-and-water patterns that reveal more the longer they're contemplated.
You don't need to be an intellectual to enjoy it; just a fan of art and science. Somewhere out there da Vinci is smiling.
Chomsky and Gondry get animated.
At best the briefest introduction to Chomsky's world, Gondry pulls off the impossible with this playfully filmed interview.
"If you're willing to be puzzled, you're able to learn," Chomsky says...To his credit (and without affectation), Gondry doesn't cloak the fact that he is often perplexed by his subject. Because of his confusion though, we are able to learn quite a lot.
Oh my, look at the density and stretch of this MIT linguist!
The man [Noam Chomsky] himself remains elusive, but he's just open enough that he remains appropriately mysterious.
