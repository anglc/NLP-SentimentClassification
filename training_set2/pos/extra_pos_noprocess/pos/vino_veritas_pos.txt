It's highly entertaining if occasionally (and appropriately) cringe-inducing and offers some fine actors the opportunity to strut their stuff. And that's the truth, sans vino.
The performances are all on the mark and while there are times when the dialogue falters, this is a smartly made film and an easy one to watch.
