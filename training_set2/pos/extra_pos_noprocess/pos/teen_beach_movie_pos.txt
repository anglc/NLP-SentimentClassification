The film's time-warp, movie-nerd conceit is just clever enough to keep you entertained.
In spite of my pasty self, there's something I liked about all the relentless mugging and frugging.
It's too bad the makers didn't do a slightly better job casting the key roles, but taken on its own terms the 95-minute Disney Channel original plays like a brightly colored beach blanket, albeit one that's a little rough around its sandy edges.
The push-and-pull between the two [main characters] is a delightful dynamic, setting the tone for other fantastic character interplays and some entertaining turns of events.
A more entertaining, clever musical than its generic title suggests.
Keeps its eye firmly on paying tribute to the classic Beach movies, all with pretty great numbers that feel like they were written in the early sixties.
