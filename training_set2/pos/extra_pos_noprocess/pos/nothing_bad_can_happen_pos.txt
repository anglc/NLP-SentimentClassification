Pitting good against evil with striking intelligence and a near-operatic commitment to extreme suffering, Ms. Gebbe neither mocks nor celebrates Tore's love for his God.
A revenge flick where the hero refuses vengeance. We want that catharsis, but if Tore ever stopped turning the other cheek, he'd lose the only thing he has left: forgiveness
Nothing Bad Can Happen examines modern faith in a way few films do.
Ultimately, this is a film that asks deep questions but offers somewhat shallow answers.
The film has a lyrical visual palette, almost like a bad memory, and Gebbe draws very strong performances from her cast.
The Passion of the German Runaway.
...evocative of Lars von Trier's similarly unflinching Dogville and equally bound to start some conversations among those willing to stomach it.
One of the most enraging films to come around in some time, a picture of very real, uncompromisingly savage horrors.
like Jesus of Montreal (1989) transferred to the outskirts of Hamburg, Katrin Gebbe's challenging debut reorients the temptation and passion of Jesus to the environs of contemporary life and to the idioms of handheld naturalism
... an amazingly sure-footed feature from first-time director Katrin Gebbe.
A horror film in which our darkest proclivities are the monster.
While I was certainly enamoured (aesthetically speaking) by the suffocating precision of Gebbe's craft, prolonged exposure is numbing. Then again, perhaps that's the point
A dark and thoughtful film with a legitimately challenging and worthwhile message.
