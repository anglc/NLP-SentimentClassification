Back in his day, Mr. Peabody was a dog whose over-civility had bite. Now he's a genius you want to cuddle with.
Fifty years ago, animated entertainment was a lot quieter. But that was my "Mr. Peabody & Sherman." This is someone else's. And it should give them, and even a few open-minded parents, almost just as much giggly fun.
Mr. Peabody & Sherman has a cool, midcentury-modern look (dog and boy live in a populuxe Manhattan penthouse) and a voice cast that may not be A-list but fits the bill nicely.
Mr. Peabody is fast-paced and jammed with rib-poking historical references, but it couldn't be called witty, even on the broadly winking level of the original cartoon.
The film's saving grace is its character design and use of 3D techniques to speed things up in every sense when the plot starts to flag.
A flawless remake that maintains the eccentric tone and wit of the original animated shorts.
This film is inventive, fascinating and endearing but also sketch-lite, a trifle dull in colour-muting 3D and emotionally detached.
This DreamWorks release avoids emotion in favor of toon-time movement.
I'll be doggoned if 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman' isn't a refreshing 'paws' from the run-of-the-mill movies that often serve as family entertainment
The film has an excellent pro-education, pro-history, pro-science, pro-geek, pro-nerd, pro-smart message, a swathe of historical tidbits, and awesome progressive details such as a schoolmate in a wheelchair for no plot reason (and never commented on).
...a vehicle that's as empty as it is entertaining.
The film has been a monster hit, so it's doing its dance with the demographic the way its supposed to. Still, one wonders whether fans of the original show will go with the bandwagon. This reviewer found the film plastic and too predictable.
Mr. Peabody proudly announces "there's no doubt about it...every dog should have a boy." And every boy (and girl) should go see "Mr. Peabody & Sherman."
I thought it was really sweet. We've seen a couple of movies about adoption lately and there's something very sweet about that whole scenario as well.
It's a pleasant, often amusing, family film with lots of kid-friendly jokes and puns but also plenty of references that will go over the heads of the smaller members of the audience.
Everything moves at a brisk pace, the voice cast has plenty of talent, and there's no shortage of witty lines.
What's more surprising is how much of the original's spirit DreamWorks is able to inject into a feature film that'll entertain young 'uns as well as potentially cynical parents.
Nevertheless, it breezes by in a whoosh of colour, fan and good humour that will win it more friends than enemies.
The film expands the material to feature length without sacrificing some solid laughs and nostalgic charm.
It is a very sweet story, with plenty of humor and adventure too. The characters are well developed. The artwork is colorful and vivid.
Full of clever, sweet and invention, Mr Peabody & Sherman is proof of the old adage (in reverse) that every dog should have a boy
Father and son relationships, time travel and being a dog have never been so much fun as in this witty, hilarious 3D animation adventure that will have the whole family barking happy
