Laconic, lost in memory but focused, Stanton slowly opens up to filmmaker-interviewer Sophie Huber.
It adds up to an unexpectedly moving portrait of a maverick at twilight.
Harry Dean Stanton is a marvelous actor and, at least from a visual standpoint, a marvelous camera subject. He's not much of a talker, though.
At the film's heart is a fitful conversation that unfolds like a string of koans, epigrams, jokes and silences. And songs.
A film that's in perfect sync with its subject.
Stanton isn't interested in giving away the details of his life and career, and no one's going to lure them out of him.
A different kind of documentary for a different kind of guy.
The artist and the art are inseparable. Stanton is a man content in the "nothing" he's carved out for himself.
A unique tribute to a unique artist.
Refreshingly stylish and enigmatic. It brings out Harry Dean Stanton's warmth, humility and sense of humor.
Alternating between color footage and the genius interplay of startlingly lovely sequences of Stanton singing and playing harmonica in granular black-and-white, Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction perfectly captures the essence of the man.
As he does in his roles, Stanton opens himself up to the camera in a way that has the indelible stamp of truth, an almost fragile sense of honesty.
An insightful, well-constructed exploration of the sad-eyed character actor's life and career.
It's a little frustrating at first to realize that Huber isn't going to get much explanation of anything from Stanton. But she ends up making a virtue of the actor's Zen calm...He's so present, it's as though he's burned into the screen.
This moody, soulful, music-drenched documentary on the great character actor uses movie clips, his singing, and shards of conversation to create its dark-hued portrait of zen survival. A real treat for those in the know.
For any fan, this is mandatory.
