At heart, it's about as naughty as an old Disney movie with Dean Jones, Suzanne Pleshette, and an unruly Great Dane. I liked its gung-ho slapstick spirit, though. No one's slacking off.
Sex Tape is wittier and less smutty than its reputation might suggest.
Does it matter that the film itself ain't that funny? Annie and Jay are mostly anodyne; Diaz and Segel really don't click.
The best news here is the elasticity of the star pairing.
