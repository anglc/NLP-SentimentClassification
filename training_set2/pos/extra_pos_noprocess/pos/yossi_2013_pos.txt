Knoller is wonderful as the emotionally cut-off, yet vulnerable Yossi, who yearns for something more from life, but feels both terror at the prospect and unworthiness to claim it.
Yossi is an early spring breeze of a film - too delicate to be substantial but definitely holding the promise of warmth.
It's serious about its characters and their emotions, but still finds room for humor.
"Yossi" has an air of lightness but never feels insignificant.
Knoller manages to make even a withdrawn character compelling, and worth rooting for as Yossi struggles to shed his shell.
a very real portrait of a man on the verge of accepting himself
Filled with many of the awkward life moments that many gay men will recognise, as well as a freshly lensed look at the new Israel, Yossi is a strong and touching take on grief.
Yossi is a stronger film than its predecessor, more deeply felt and less reliant on love-story conventions.
... an awfully familiar fantasy-for gays and straights alike-about an emotionally repressed older man saved by a young beauty who sees the kind soul and intelligence under the frumpy surface.
Fox understands that the joys and tears of looking for love are not unique to gay Israeli men...viewers can relate to the emotional conflicts regardless of one's orientation.
Fox has graduated from amateur to modest professional.
...[Knoller's] portrayal of a person locked in his own grief is both realistic and sympathetic, and Fox brings events to a conclusion that is more than worth the wait.
Directed by Eytan Fox, the gifted helmer of the international hit Walk on Water, 'Yossi,' a work of special depth, is yet another of his incisive character studies of a man who doesn't quite fit in until he finally does.
