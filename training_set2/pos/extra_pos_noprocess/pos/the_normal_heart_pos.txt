There is less reporting on poverty in America than on any other major societal issue. So it is with AIDS. That alone makes The Normal Heart an important film.
If anger and suffering were all there were to The Normal Heart, watching it would be torture. Luckily, it has heart to match its guts.
Matt Bomer is heartbreaking as a New York Times style reporter looking for love in a loveless city. His physical transformation is astonishing and agonizing.
Time, and rewrites, have softened some of the play's stridency. More important, the romance between Weeks (Ruffalo) and his lover, Felix (Bomer), is given a more prominent role as is Felix's death spiral, giving the story power both broad and intimate.
Moving, well acted and important for a generation who may be unfamiliar with the source material. But the TV version, also written by Kramer, doesn't have the emotional heft of the play.
Watch at your own risk, but to not watch the film - or more importantly, learn from it - is an even higher risk.
Larry Kramer's blistering cri de coeur about the early days of the AIDS plague gets a solidly respectful but flawed treatment from Ryan Murphy.
proves that, sometimes, art does a better job of understanding history than the actual record
The collaboration between Murphy and Kramer seemed like a natural from the moment it was announced, and now we have the proof of that sensible decision -- in all its incendiary, heart-wrenching magnificence.
It's an impressive, relevant, and moving ensemble drama that I can't recommend enough.
Although The Normal Heart is a work of fiction, the stories it tells about the emerging AIDS crisis in America are honest and heartbreakingly real, thanks to deeply affecting performances.
Despite its flaws, this iteration of The Normal Heart also exhorts us to remember.
A riveting drama about three years in the early AIDS crisis and the struggle of a gay writer fighting the indifference of so many people to this epidemic in New York City.
Absolutely retains its significance, it's the execution from director Ryan Murphy that's worthy of dismissal, allowing a heavy-handedness to drive the provocative material into frustrating repetition.
It's movies like The Normal Heart, fuelled by the performances within it, that make you want to learn more and provide perspective on one of the bleakest times for the gay community. That, and increase Kleenex sales at Costco.
If you can get past the director's tics and tricks, there are some bravura scenes from Mantello, Roberts and Ruffalo that are worth the price of admission.
The Normal Heart is not as powerful as Kramer's incendiary play, but it is still too passionate and potently acted to miss.
A pretty decent adaptation of the 1985 stage script, with some good things added, including an effective pre-credit section set on Fire Island in 1982.
A passionately-written and heart-wrenching portrayal of real life events, this drama painfully offers a look at the earliest victims of the AIDS epidemic.
