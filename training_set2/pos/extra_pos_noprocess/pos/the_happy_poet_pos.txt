[Paul Gordon generates] good-natured humor through earthy characterization and precise observation of what it's like to run a small business. (His editing, which often approximates the rhythm of workaday drudgery, is clever without being cutesy.)
It's hardly slick, but that's the selling point. The Happy Poet approaches the ups and downs of friendship, love, work and life with a disposition that is both sardonic and sunny.

Sincerely tells about an underdog geek trying to survive in a world ruled by capitalists.
