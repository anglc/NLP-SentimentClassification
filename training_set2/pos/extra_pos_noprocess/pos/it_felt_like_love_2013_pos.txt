In Gina Piersanti, also making her feature debut, Hittman has found the perfect actress to portray the difficult undertaking of growing up, or at least trying to.
Hittman draws attention to the pervasive cultural forces (rap music, Internet pornography, suggestive dancing on TV) that present young girls as sexual objects, making the scenes of exploitation seem sadly inevitable.
Rarely has the zone between girlhood and womanhood been captured with such urgent honesty than in Eliza Hittman's superb teen drama "It Felt Like Love."
It's easy to be seduced by the loosely observational vibe of the movie, even as its tale of a shrinking violet struggling not to be a late bloomer fails to strike more than a single note of dismay.
Gorgeously shot in Brooklyn's beachfront neighborhoods and devoid of easy sentimentality, "It Felt Like Love" features realistic performances all around, understandable given the cast of mostly first-time actors.
It Felt Like Love doesn't exactly have a plot, which feels absolutely right for a film whose elliptical yet intensely focused visual style seem to flow directly from Lila's consciousness.
[Hittman's] offbeat visual style ... helps put you inside the mind of the lead character, for whom nothing is clear.
It's neither overly sentimental nor obnoxiously cautionary.
First-time feature filmmaker Hittman, working with the talented DP Sean Porter, has a natural way with visuals that communicates the curiosity running rabid through the blood of summer-idle teenagers.
The scenes between Lila, Sammy, and Sammy's macho friends feature some of Hittman's most acute dialogue and direction.
"It Felt Like Love" doesn't just unreel before your eyes, it weighs on you.
A coming-of-age movie down to its marrow.
More than anything else, It Felt Like Love successfully turns the coming-of-age formula into a foreboding nightmare.
While there's nothing unusual about seeing a teenager trying to break free of the unindividuated and invisible state of childhood, the way in which it unfolds in Eliza Hittman's debut feature is deeply uncomfortable.
