"Bad Milo!" is a cult classic in the making.
This movie is about a monster that crawls out of a man's butt and starts killing people.
disgusting and grotesque, but also funny throughout, and amiable precisely because of its great affection for even the most odious of its characters, as befits a film so preoccupied with arseholes.
While it's a black comedy, the humor is derived from situational issues rather than becoming a joke on itself.
...Bad Milo! is about a man who has a monster that grows out of his ass and kills people. If you're not willing to get onboard with that premise, this isn't a movie that's going to sway your initial feelings.
It's funny, it's gross, and it has a few serious things on its mind. Is it any wonder David Cronenberg is thanked in the end credits?
This is Marino's film all the way, and the comic vet of Wet Hot American Summer and Party Down effortlessly steps into the spotlight after decades in supporting roles.
Call it odious, call it repugnant, call it downright nasty - just don't call it dumb.
On paper, "Bad Milo!" sounds loosey-goosey-crazy-go-nuts. But in practice, it's understated, if only in relation to its bonkers premise.
Should entertain a certain pocket of comedy fans, particularly those happy for the rare chance to see the excellent Marino play a nice guy.
It's not every day one encounters a story about a man and the goblin that uses his rectum as a home, making the little triumphs of the feature worthy of a look, but only for those in the mood for something odd and a little icky.
