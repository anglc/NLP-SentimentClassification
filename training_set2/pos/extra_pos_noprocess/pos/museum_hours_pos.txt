Sommer is perfect. So is O'Hara. This is the "Before Sunrise" for a very different (and platonic) pair of individuals.
Amid all the looking and dissection, Cohen demonstrates an understanding of the individual need for increasingly elusive privacy that feels urgent, wistful, and quaint.
The quiet time that Johann and Anne spend during museum hours -- and after his shifts on trips around the city -- offer solace in their mutual solitude. Museum Hours is an introverted companion for its viewers.
The two leads contribute fresh, genuine performances, and what might have been a musty academic exercise gains in tension from Cohen's deft juxtaposing of vocal narration, character detail, and majestic artwork.
It's as if Cohen had lived for centuries among these places, and sometimes with art that encapsulates these centuries, and is pleasantly imprisoned within its strength.
When Cohen's film is over and the lights go out, the world is not the same anymore.
A Chris Marker kind of exceptional experimental film that sets its sights on observing art, the landscape, people, Vienna and our sense of being.
Cohen's simple, masterful film considers how we anoint value.
...encourages you to see the aesthetic potential of everything around you, including each frame that appears on the screen.
This goes on for more than two hours and will bore some viewers to death. Others, though, will find this quiet, complex film a fascinating piece of art in itself.
Great art has the power to comment on life's issues - sex, death, parenthood, religion, etc. - and Cohen uses the power of the still image to construct a film of moving ones with power of its own.
As we learn how to look at the Kunsthistorisches' masterpieces, we're also learning how to watch this movie. ... And better: we're learning how to look at our lives.
Museum Hours is one of those artsy-fartsy meditations on life that you see sometimes in the better cinemas. The good news is it turns out to be more artsy than fartsy: There's plenty to think about here.
Calm entertainment.
Most successful at its most hushed and explicitly 'artful,' in the museum; less interesting when it becomes more casual, as when Johann and Mary hang out and discuss general topics at coffeehouses. (Mary is nice, but, frankly, a bit of a bore.)
A contemplative experimental drama, it also invites moviegoers to take a deep breath, to relax, and to float along in its leisurely exploration of leisurely exploration.
The result is an experience not unlike going to a museum itself: a chance to peruse wondrous things in a sacred space. For an evening, a movie theater becomes a place where art and life become beautifully entangled.
The reward is an intelligent, observant effort that extracts a purity of existence from the nuances of art and enjoys the beauty of human connection.
