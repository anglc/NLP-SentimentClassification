This Is Martin Bonner takes a magnifying glass to everyday goodness and lingering pain, illuminating their contours and complexities but pulling away before the movie can ever burst into sentimental flame.
Mr. Eenhoorn (whose patient expressions here suggest a kindly priest) gives his character the shy charm of palpable decency.
Patience is privileged, nothing is forced, and by the end of this quietly devastating character study, the ordinary has become extraordinary.
By calling on his leads to underplay nearly every moment, Hartigan calls into question our deeply ingrained instinct, as moviegoers, to witness a steady parade of amped-up emotions.
Rigorously subdued in performance and tone, this low-key character portrait is distinguished by its empathetic honesty.
Inspiring in a way that movies too often aren't, in that it provides a realistic yet optimistic vision of how someone can positively affect the world around them
Thankfully it avoids the sentimentality of so many other similar redemption indie pics.
A lovely film makes use of fundamental Christian belief, and of lonely men in their autumn years, and of second chances forced upon us, subjects not generally celebrated in Hollywood.
... exquisite character development, observant filmmaking, and storytelling that just might change the way people live.
Chad Hartigan's This is Martin Bonner is a refreshing example of stark realism, minus the grit and melodrama that tends to muddy films of its ilk.
Somewhere far beyond the hoary parables of most faith-based films and the brutal body-blows of prison flicks soars This Is Martin Bonner, an understated drama with small words and big ideas.
At its best, with its quiet, ominous pace in the early going and its economical distribution of information throughout, the film is reminiscent of Todd Haynes's Safe.
The detail is precise, as are the performances. These may not be people you would care to see a film about, but seeing it I can't imagine that you wouldn't be moved to care about them.
The rare contemporary film about Christian behavior that doesn't go out of its way to announce its secularity, it's equally unpatronizing in its sharp articulation of loneliness in middle age and beyond.
Huge warmth is emitted from beautifully realised performances and scripting.
For those with a willingness to go with the flow and discover the wonder hiding beneath the surface, This Is Martin Bonner is a triumph of the elegant kind.
