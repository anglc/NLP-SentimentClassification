Vivid and folksy, Fire & Rescue nicely exceeds expectations dampened by last summer's stalled-out Planes.
As it is in the merchandising aisle, so it is on the big screen: "Planes: Fire and Rescue" is precisely long, competent, and entertaining enough to be sold, and sold well.
Not only are the cliches more deftly packaged this time around, the action scenes - with long, exciting tracking shots of planes flying through valleys and over wild fires - often look like they were directed by James Cameron.
Somehow, this sequel to a rubbish spin-off to a rubbish sequel to a so-so cartoon is actually pretty good.
Despite the fact that this too-soon spin-off feels like a mere cash-in on the Disney Cars/Planes marketing machine, this sequel is actually a lot more fun than expected.
If it does become faintly dull and preachy, the trim humour and detailing - the CHiPs spoof CHoPs, Motorjito cocktails, the pickup truck with superb pickup lines - soon get it squarely back on the fun runway.
Perhaps these rock-bottom expectations are a good thing, because Planes 2 feels like a significant upgrade on its distinctly run-of-the-mill predecessor...
An old-fashioned kiddie flick with a straightforward story, simple characters, a heartfelt message and impressive 3D flying scenes. Smaller children should love it.
Disney have an opportunity to engage children with something profound and real if they continue to pursue hero stories like these.
Not much magic, but an appreciable level of polish.
The key to the film's relative success is the fact that it simply tells its straight dramatic story with a bare minimum of zany comic interludes.
