Eye-popping photography should draw viewers to this thoughtful, revealing doc.
Summer's blitz of apocalypse movies has nothing on this bee doc.
Oblique narrative aside, you can't beat the film's eye-popping visuals.
What's really frightening about Honey isn't what a hive of angry bees might do to us, but what we've done to them.
[Markus] Imhoof makes bees more important than they have previously seemed.
Imhoof's film is remarkable in its close-up photography. The bees loom large, like creatures from some mutant planet; dangle together in a delicate chain; and fill the air, floating like unusually vivid dust specks.
Imhoof's globetrotting odyssey is more concerned with contemplation than investigation.
Markus Imhoof's bee documentary is so stuffed with surreal tableaux it makes your head spin.
It is the elegance of its images that sets it apart from previous doomed bee documentaries. The footage of individual animals going about their business is a sight to behold.
More Than Honey is a phenomenally well-researched and thorough study of bees and their complex influence on human civilization, and an in depth investigation of the honeybee colony collapse disorder.
Stinging but positive film about bees.
In all, More than Honey makes for surprisingly stimulating fare.
There is a lot to be learned from this thoughtful film as you marvel at the amazingly intimate images of colony life.
An interesting, and interestingly laidback film, an almost restful look at honeybees and the way they are kept and cultivated across the world.
A fascinating, informative and startling documentary that explores the disappearance of the honeybee.
You come out of the film none the wiser as to where the bees have all gone. But you still learn a hell of a lot about them.
Elegant, handsomely shot and often instructive, and its remarkable extended close-up sequences of bees' social structure are fascinating.
Feels slightly diffuse in its analysis.
Informative and occasionally scary.
Astonishing macro-photography captures the bees in all their surreal beauty, presenting a tribute to nature's "messenger of love" and a warning of what might be lost.
