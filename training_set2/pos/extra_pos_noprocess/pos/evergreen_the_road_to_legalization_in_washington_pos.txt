A taut, thorough chronicle of the 2012 campaign to pass Initiative 502 - which proposed legalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use - "Evergreen" is an energetic study of a hard-fought battle.
Portraying emotion and devil's advocacy are this balanced film's strong suits.
Dual focus on the need to end the ineffective, destructive "war on drugs" and broader questions of political compromise gives director Riley Morton's film particular resonance.
[An] assured documentary ...
A fascinating case study in the promise and perils of ballot-box democracy, and the give-and-take nature of social progress.
...does what most activist documentaries about hot-button issues don't: It successfully shows all sides of the argument.
...a conventional and straightforward documentary...[but] well done and well worth seeing if you have any interest in either pot or the political process.
Although there is little new in this film, in either information or presentation, it is an accurate and detailed documentation of how the law works right.
More than meets the eye. It is not just about the need to legalize a harmless weed but also about the divisions in the pro-legalization community on how to do it right.
The lack of suspense results in something like a one-sided pat on the back for everyone involved.
