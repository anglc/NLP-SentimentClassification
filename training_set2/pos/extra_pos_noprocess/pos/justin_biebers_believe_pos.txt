Films like this work best when exalting is the task, and when it comes to displaying Mr. Bieber in his milieu - on stage - it shines.
Justin Bieber's Believe is exactly the movie you think it is, and that's fine.
Director Jon M Chu throws a few curlies at Bieber about fame, philanthropy, artistic integrity and the bum fluff growing in the space between his nose and his mouth where a mustache would normally go.
Earnest pop star docu should please true Beliebers.
It's for the fans. And on that level it works.
Even if it doesn't ask all the right question or provide the answers we're looking for, Justin Bieber's Believe is a perfectly harmless piece of work that will send fangirls the world over into a tizzy.
