An effectively relentless gore-fest.
A stylish and worthy homage: inventive even as it is derivative, never quite jokey but never taking itself too seriously, and clocking in at an entirely appropriate 91 minutes. Any longer would be unmerciful; any shorter, ungenerous.
Though it never channels the raw DIY energy of the original Evil Dead series -- what big-budget version could? -- this polished, clever remake remains true to the spirit of the original, which was at once viscerally terrifying and weirdly lighthearted.
Too ludicrous to take seriously, yet too po-faced to laugh at, it sacrifices wit and energy for intensity.
Rarely do you find a modern reboot that has the power to satisfy fans of a revered franchise while simultaneously grabbing audiences unfamiliar with the original and kicking them in the teeth.
A masterful new version that adds even more value to Sam Raimi's masterpiece than ever.
This Evil Dead isn't as flavorful as the old one, and it doesn't try as many different things. But on the promises it does make, it delivers.
An (extremely) blood good time that will likely please horror fans.
It's not great, it's not quite as anarchic as the original or as you want it to be, but as a gorefest aiming to pop you out of your seat a few times, it does the trick.
Alvarez does show some directorial flair but this is not as frightening as it would like to believe it is, nor as interesting.
The film is about nothing more than Alvarez devising amusingly fiendish ways of freaking out audiences.
Alvarez doesn't succeed in making Evil Dead terrifying, but he does make it as prodigiously intense and gory for our time as the original was for its own.
A spookily effective remake of the ultra-low budget 1981 cult horror classic by Sam Raimi, the gore and blood is so plentiful here it even falls from the sky...A must for fans, Evil Dead also affirms horror as the most remake-friendly genre going.
Alvarez seems to know where to pay tribute to the original... but he also knows where to depart... Overall, his new movie packs a punch.
... not for people prone to nightmares. It's highly effective as causing involuntary chills and hand movements (as in, up to eyes to block the bloody chaos onscreen). ... a cut above just about any other modern horror/slasher remake
