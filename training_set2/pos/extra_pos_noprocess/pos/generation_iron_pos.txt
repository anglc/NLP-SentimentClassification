The oversized men who compete for the title of Mr. Olympia in this illuminating documentary are articulate and serious-minded, with some muscling through adversity to find a way to their dreams.
"Iron" opens a window to an exclusive club and gives valuable insight into a small, dedicated and proudly unique community.
Yudin's deft cameras admiringly capture these iconically sculpted men without overly objectifying them, should the prospect of eyeballing all that posing-strapped beef give any potential viewers pause.
A gorgeous meditation on age-old existential concerns.
...just about enough memorable quotes, eloquence, personality, and pathos to divert even those of us with no interest in sport.
Suffers from a reality TV-ish veneer in its decided lack of depth.
While Yudin gives us plenty of room to laugh at them, he also acknowledges their capacity to inspire awe - not only at their bulging muscles, but at their willingness to go all the way with the infantile wish to look bigger than anyone else.
Yudin gets into the psyches of his subjects. Their ups and downs, highs and lows. The need to do well in competitions not only for personal glory but for the sponsorships that feed their families and keep them in the gym.
Well-crafted, sympathetic and apparently fairly honest, but not as novel as it would have been in the pre-reality TV era, when the home lives of participants in obsessive family units and strange subcultures weren't an entertainment staple.
... we are left to consider natural gifts versus applied science, and ponder why we usually credit the former more than the latter. Like all good stories, this movie about bodybuilding is really about much more.
The film ends up being about much more than itself, much more than just bodybuilding or bodybuilders. Although a bit overlong, it is really a triumph of intelligent, strategic filmmaking.
Suspenseful, well-edited and adequately illuminating without being too heavy or dry
