This message-driven film is perfectly fine for kids around 10, though it is a little light on humour. Adults accompanying said kids, though, are strongly advised not to think too hard as the predictable tale unfolds.
The inspired casting of Bindi Irwin adds an extra element to this sun-drenched family adventure... Making good use of the beautiful Queensland rainforest + beach setting, this sequel has plenty of appeal
