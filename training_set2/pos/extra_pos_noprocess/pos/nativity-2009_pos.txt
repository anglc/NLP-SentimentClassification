A warm, funny and irreverent Christmas movie that ought to become a holiday classic alongside films like 'Elf' and 'A Christmas Story.'
A plucky, well-meant enterprise reliant on its audience's festive goodwill.
Neither Jensen nor Freeman light up the film - that is left to the gap-toothed, wide-eyed, body-popping and very funny kids.
Funny, sweet and family-friendly seasonal fare.
For all that's wrong with Nativity!, there's something apt and endearing about how this sketchy, secondâ€‘rate production pulls its socks up for the climax.
Nativity! is a light and painless watch that overcomes its flaws with some strong central performances and a genuine warmth that lifts it above the cynicism of many other festive cash-grabbers.
Sweet, funny, bags of charm: Outnumbered meets Britain's Got Talent, with added Christmas.
It's the pure, device-free performances of the talented cast of children that makes this a winner and that rare thing - a Christmas movie that actually captures a pocketful of its spirit.
The grown-ups are pretty much overshadowed by the youthful cast of the nativity play itself, who are so natural on camera that you can't help but smile.
So deliriously corny that I can imagine it becoming the unlikeliest hit of the year.
