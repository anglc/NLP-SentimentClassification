It was something I hope they try again. Because in truth, it wasn't good, but I enjoyed it.
Considering this was the first live musical theater effort for the medium in 50 years, it ranks as a successful curiosity that may inspire a new generation to explore further.
The Sound Of Music Live! proved that the format can work, even if the product still needs some polishing.
What I liked about The Sound of Music Live was that, for a moment anyhow, it made me forget that it's 2013.
Telecast of classic has same great music, not as much magic.
This was a pleasurable one-night-only stunt that felt like a major TV event.
This is one of those rare TV events that will be well worth recording or watching live.
