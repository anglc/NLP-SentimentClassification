Del Toro is a dreamer. He's a visionary. If you give him a pile of money to make enormous robots fight enormous monsters at the end of civilization, he will work to make Pacific Rim a movie that makes you feel all the enormousness.
A ridiculously entertaining (and often just plain ridiculous) monster-robot movie that plays like that "Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots" game from the 1960s.
Pacific Rim is a cut above the standard-gauge heavy-metal blockbuster, with less cynicism, more soul, a wealth of visual detail and a desperate pulse of intelligence beneath the mayhem. But it's still profoundly silly.
There's so much onscreen, so much suggested but not explored or explained, almost like jam-packed Harvey Kurtzman panels from classic MAD magazines, detailed by the likes of a Romanek or Tarsem.
Michael Bay has made three Transformers movies, and he hasn't done one yet that was as much fun as this.
Pacific Rim is, as you might expect, a visual extravaganza brimming with lush colors, state-of-the-art CGI effects and the promised robots on monsters hard-core fights to the death.
From a pure fan-boy perspective, this film packs in a great deal of energy without feeling like a stale Michael Bay film. Guillermo del Toro mixes playful energy with outstanding effects.
Bro, it comes down to this: if you can't turn the brain meat off and sit back and enjoy Charlie Hunnam, Rinko Kikuchi and Idris Elba beating the crap out of some monsters then, dude, you're the monster.
Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim is awesome, scary, weird, exciting, exuberant, and ridiculous -- basically everything you want from a sci-fi action movie.
Feels like it's always struggling to break through the screen-if only to grab you by the scruff of the neck and drag you in.
Pacific Rim is the perfect example of how to make an effective summer blockbuster. It has heart, brains and enough action and explosions to shock and awe just about anyone.
A blockbuster of substance and depth...
The plot is well designed considering how silly the movie really is. Credit that to Guillermo Del Toro. He obviously put a lot of though into the picture, but it's still a basic action film, and the selling point is giant robots battling giant monsters.
If it sounds kinda fun, please know it is, with those aforementioned scientists (TV faces Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) creating some laughs with their goofy nature of oneupsmanship.
