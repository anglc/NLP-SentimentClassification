Dom is effusive with self-destructive charisma, the kind of loose cannon you'd follow into an all-night bender in spite of your better judgment.
You don't so much care where Dom is going as how he's getting there, and he's getting there loud.
"Dom Hemingway" has two terrific things going for it: snappy dialogue (I was quite fond of the accusation "You disrespected my cat") and Law, who's both funny and scary in equal measures.
The title character of this florid crime comedy could be an escapee from a Tarantino script, all flashy character traits and verbal overkill.
Dom Hemingway is often viciously funny, and every time you think the movie has run out of steam, Shepard spins things in a new direction, keeping the energy from flagging (including one of the most startling car crashes I've ever seen in a film).
While Law bellows blasphemous poetry, his director orchestrates a noirish light show with a cockeyed rhythm.
The results are so delightful you can't help hoping Law lets his hairline recede and gym membership expire.
Dom Hemingway lives or dies by the audience's identification with its protagonist.
