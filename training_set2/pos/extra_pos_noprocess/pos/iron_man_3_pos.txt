Shane Black excels at writing witty, self-referential, pop-infused banter, and there is no actor working today who is better suited to delivering it than Robert Downey Jr.
Black is good at giving his heroes a morbid, self-hating edge and even better at coming up with hateable villains.
Iron Man 3 is, perhaps by default, the best comic book superhero "threequel" yet.
Robert Downey Jr. is clearly having a blast playing a more sardonic Tony Stark.
The movie works mainly due to its acting.
Downey is a brilliant actor who somehow manages to portray Tony Stark as traumatised without losing the character's laidback and comedic quality.
Writer/director Shane Black... brings sharp snarky humor and some welcome psychological depth to the Iron Man franchise, which faded in an exhausting second installment after the exhilarating original.
The film's true strength is a snappy, whip-smart wit
Robert Downey, Jr. makes Iron Man one of the most entertaining superheroes in the Marvel movie universe.
The most mature of the "Iron Man" films by far.
Marvel Studios lets director Black off the leash for this third installment, and while the result is edgier, sexier, and more dangerous than what has come before, you may not recognize Tony Stark as the man from the long-running comic.
Funnier and smoother, more surprising, defter at being creative while still working within the confines of the superhero formula.
