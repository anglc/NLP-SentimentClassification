Fantastic visuals and non-stop action make for a spectacular, romantic Chinese CGI feast.
Beautiful martial arts fantasy with scary imagery, violence.
The Sorcerer and the White Snake is unfortunately just another average Jet Li film to throw into the pile. Its bloated and overloaded use of mediocre special effects practically shackles the film to its humdrum atmosphere.
A masterpiece of imagination. Offers wall-to-wall goofy fun for fans of martial arts flicks, fantasies, or just good old-fashioned cinematic nuttiness.
Though The Sorcerer and the White Snake is excessive and at times jumbled, younger viewers will surely respond to the colourful characters and settings, and the bold vision on display is charming... for the most part.
