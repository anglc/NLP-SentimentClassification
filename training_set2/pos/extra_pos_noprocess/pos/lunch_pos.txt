It's inspiring to see greats like Reiner still sharp and funny, or even a very frail Caesar rousing himself on cue to do a bit of shtick.
Low-key and low-tech, "Lunch" coasts on the earned wisdom of pros who know how to work a room.
It's worth pulling up a chair.
The appeal of Lunch might be limited to Hollywood-nostalgia buffs, but they will be enthralled not only by the stories told, but also how they're told. These guys are still some of the sharpest wits in town.
An agreeable visit with comedy titans who clearly cherish the opportunity to regale their peers with war stories and opinions about the state of comedy today.
Ingratiating, if too short, record of a Hollywood institution anyone would be happy to attend.
