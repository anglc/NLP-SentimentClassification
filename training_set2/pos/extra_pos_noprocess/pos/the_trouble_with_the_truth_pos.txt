Who knew My Dinner with Andre could be reworked into such an engaging romantic comedy?
Jim Hemphill's "The Trouble with the Truth" is a pleasant surprise that gets better as the movie unfolds.
Although they talk enough to qualify for radio, John Shea and Lea Thompson make the high-wire act of "The Trouble With the Truth" a convincing, moving and provocative two-hander.
A divorced couple rehash their relationship in this touching indie drama.
[An] intimate, honest exploration of relationship dynamics, regret and the enduring messiness of love.
While it never quite lives up to its lofty inspiration, particularly in an unsatisfying final act, it's engagingly written and well played by both leads.
A spare but winning romantic drama that taps into the same talky, intellectually stimulating vein as Richard Linklater's Sunrise/Sunset collaborations with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.
Don't let this small but potent little gem pass by.
Wise, warm, sexy and sophisticated with tender, well-nuanced performances by John Shea and Lea Thompson.
Shea and Thompson are up against it due to the basic premise alone, so they could be somewhat forgiven for stumbling here or there. But they don't...
A delectable dialogue driven movie over dinner. And a banquet of conversation in the ongoing battle of the sexes that is simultaneously bracing, witty, invigorating, stinging, solemn and funny.
Lea Thompson and John Shea sit down 'My Dinner With Andre' style and chew the fat about love, life, longing and letting go, in this unexpectedly poignant, often wryly humorous, drama.
