If a personal memoir film by a beautiful, successful young woman from a nice Toronto family sounds to you like it can only be an excuse for self-absorbed navel-gazing, well, you must not have seen a Sarah Polley movie yet.
Stories We Tell is one of those movies you watch on a screen and replay in your head for days, moving between its many levels of inquiry and touched, always, by Polley's compassion toward her relatives in particular and people in general.
Sarah Polley's remarkable Stories We Tell transcends every cliche in this confessional/investigatory genre, and it's one of the year's highlights.
Everyone has a different story. I found myself holding my breath listening to them talk. The story twists like a thriller.
Stories We Tell is not just very moving; it is an exploration of truth and fiction that will stay with you long after repeated viewings.
What "Stories We Tell" has to offer viewers above all else, is the lesson and harsh fact that no matter how closely we hold someone in our hearts, we never really know them one hundred percent.
The Polleys are so charming and down-to-earth, and their pain so tangible, it's an absolute heart-breaker.
What Polley unearths is a well of emotion and one of the most powerful new films I've seen in recent memory.
Simply the most enthralling, idiosyncratic and entertaining family memoir around.
Post-post-modern. Yeah, that's right, the negation of the negation.
Sarah Polley digs and digs and discovers some shocking skeletons in her own family's closet.
Deeply affectionate and sometimes very moving.
Sarah Polley doesn't just understand this slippery sense of personal truth, she opens a throbbing vein of her own history in the stunning new documentary Stories We Tell.
When a film like Stories We Tell comes along, you're reminded how powerful and universal even the most intimate and individual lives can be when captured with intelligence and perspective.
Tender, thoughtful and complex.
One of the many amazing things about this personal documentary by Toronto actor and filmmaker Sarah Polley is how horribly wrong it could have gone -- but didn't.
Polley's ability to uncover truth and to present it for public consumption is bold and brave, and bodes well for her (hopefully) continued doc career.
Stories We Tell, uniquely, reveals its process as if we are thinking, sifting and selecting along with the filmmaker.
First it's a family-tree detective story, then a playful meta-movie, then a maternal melodrama. and along the way, it weaves strong feelings into a dissection of storytelling and truth.
With Away From Her and Take This Waltz, actress Sarah Polley became one of the freshest directorial voices of her generation. Stories We Tell doesn't just solidify this assertion, it makes you reappraise how personal those first two films are for her.
It's the best and most generous creative thing Polley's ever done, not least because she's the only person in the world who could have done it.
