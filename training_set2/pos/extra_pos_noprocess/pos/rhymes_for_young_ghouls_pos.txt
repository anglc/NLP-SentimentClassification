Writer-director Barnaby weaves a surprising amount of tenderness into the fabric of violence, as well as a good measure of magic realism, to keep the gritty story engaging.
Barnaby puts a mythic frame around a grim history, shaping it in a way that feels always like a creative adventure, not a duty.
With a tone alternating between mournful, defiant and hopeful, Rhymes for Young Ghouls is a rewarding experience by a talented director who's sure to make his mark on Canadian cinema.
The film is told with a mix of lyricism and kicks to the gut, and is all the better for these shifts in tonality. It's remarkable how the narrative feels both highly specific to this community, yet near mythic in a more universal, classic sense.
