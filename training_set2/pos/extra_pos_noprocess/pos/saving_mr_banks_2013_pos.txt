Pencil Thompson in now for an Oscar nomination, and maybe a win, and prepare to leave the theater humming the iconic songs.
The sap doesn't run too thick, although it does run, and the movie certainly has a patented Disney upbeat feel much of the time. It's more a spoonful of sugar than medicine for aging baby boomer's souls.
Smart, delightful.
The picture is eventually about the therapeutic limitations of art even while celebrating the very real effect it can have on people who need it.
It's a wonderful film that deserves your attention, and that you deserve to experience.
Beautifully ambitious and eagerly constructed, the success of Walt Disney Studios' homage to its heritage is anchored magnificently by the crowning work of Emma Thompson's career.
A familiar and very satisfying collision of art versus commerce or lowbrow, mainstream taste...versus highbrow sophistication.

Saving Mr Banks is an unexpected gem, a witty and warm-hearted celebration of two great storytellers that adroitly balances delicious culture-clash comedy with affecting biographical insights.
There's great care to preserve the Disney brand with this film, which at times goes overboard with its reverence but never stoops to the point of being cheesy.
