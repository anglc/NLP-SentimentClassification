Low key, low budget and low energy, this animated space odyssey from the writer and director Geoff Marslett accompanies three mismatched astronauts to the red planet and the search for new life forms.
A memorably odd, mellow affair.
Deserves a fate better than collecting dust, especially when its potential cult status is written all over it from frame one.
It's mumblecore in space, and If that sounds like your thing, then Mars can be a rewarding experience.
The United States's first couple being a cigar-smoking cowboy and his intellectually challenged wife is one anachronism we could all live without.
Imaginative, visually stylish and refreshingly character-driven albeit somewhat contrived. It could have been much more brilliant and compelling had it taken more risks by increasing its satirical bite.
