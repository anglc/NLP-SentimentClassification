The plot is of little importance - the spectacular action and gorgeous landscapes and costumes are what matter.
The Guillotines is an overdramatic and fluffy piece of cinema that has a few decent moments, but is otherwise forgettable.
Although a bit too gory for me and difficult to follow at times, the film also boasts some gorgeous visuals as well as intriguing characters played by Ethan Juan and Xiaoming Huang.
