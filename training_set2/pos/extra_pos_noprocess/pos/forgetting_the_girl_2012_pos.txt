First-time director Nate Taylor skillfully evokes a clammy sense of dread in this stealthily suspenseful indie thriller.
Written with a poet's ear and directed with an artist's eye ...
Thanks to some well-drawn characters and tight casting, including Anna Camp and Lindsay Beamish as an exceptionally troubled makeup artist, Taylor overcomes the script's minor implausibilities.
If anything, that's a reason for applauding a smaller indie like Forgetting the Girl, which has no discernible genre, and is never entirely predictable.
Surprising, clever and twisted with a convincingly sweet and creepy performance by Christopher Denham.
A well observed, well acted character study about damaged souls whose orbits begin to exert a further destabilizing gravitational pull on one another. There's a smooth confidence at work here that never tips over into flamboyant stylistic overreach.
