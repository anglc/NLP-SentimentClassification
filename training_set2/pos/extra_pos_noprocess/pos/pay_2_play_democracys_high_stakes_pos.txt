For an advocacy agitprop, the film has researched, sourced and interviewed exhaustively.
Ennis is an optimist at heart, and his belief that one person can make a difference is infectious, if naive.
Serves as a primer, and as a wake up call for those unfamiliar with the Citizen's United decision, gerrymandering, vote suppression, ALEC, the Koch Brothers, and the many other ways money corrupts politics.
Persuasive and frightening. It's much more illuminating and thorough than Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story.
