This intelligent, sensitive doc gets a bit pretentious as today's stars read Monroe's words.
Remove the comma from the title and Love, Marilyn plays like the command it is.
A heartfelt and well-intentioned love letter to an already deeply beloved star, and for anyone who's still not convinced, the picture works hard to make the case for Monroe's gifts as an actress.
Monroe's vulnerability and sense of inadequacy, her frustration and solitude, come through poignantly.
Given the number of Marilyn memorials already out there, this is just another pleasant, un-revelatory way to say goodbye Norma Jean.
If not quite on the level of Garbus's terrific Bobby Fischer documentary, this is still filled with fond recollections of Mazza's life and career. Fans will relish it.
It doesn't provide blinding new insight into Monroe's life but it is filled with less familiar newsreel footage and decent movie clips and has some brief, invaluable glimpses of a troubled inner life.
Garbus is able to re-stitch Monroe's life in a most compelling and original manner.
By the end of the film, we learn just about everything about Monroe was self-created, which somehow makes the eventual self-destruction a little more understandable, and her life story a cautionary meditation on the booby-traps of celebrity.
The monologues are like exercises from the star's beloved Actors Studio, performances of emotional facets. For the most part these are effectively stark, tender, childlike and raw.
