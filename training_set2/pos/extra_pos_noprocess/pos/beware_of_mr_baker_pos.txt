It's refreshing to watch a music doc, especially one with such intimate access to its subject, in which barely anyone is unreservedly polite about the person in question.
Ginger Baker has been revealed as a major talent, an innovator and an unlikely survivor. And a not very nice guy.
Ginger Baker is, and was, a train wreck. Yet this film, like Baker's onstage playing, is always riveting, and something you can't look away from.
"Beware of Mr. Baker" is comprehensive, if somewhat overly glowing.
The takeaway: great musician, deficient family man, taxing friend and bandmate, excellent documentary subject.
This is warts and all, with the emphasis on the warts.
An entertaining doc on the volatile but great jazz and rock drummer, the controversial London born Ginger Baker.
The constantly gripping film is adroitly assembled.
With no preconceptions, I found this to be one of the films of the year - an extraordinary story about an even more astonishing talent.
Bleakly entertaining, Beware of Mr Baker neither eulogises nor patronises its subject; one day (though possibly not soon), Baker may take it upon himself to say thanks.
It's a broadly forgiving portrait of an impossible, irascible talent, who seems to have treated life much like his instrument.
We are always being told that books and movies have to have "sympathetic" lead characters - well, here's a documentary that does very well without one.
An interesting character study interspersed with classic rock, jazz and Afrobeat clips. Nothing more, but certainly nothing less.
Entertaining documentary about the notoriously cantankerous drummer...
It's all insanely enjoyable.
Searingly honest and ultimately deeply moving, this is a fascinating portrait of notoriously antisocial former Cream drummer Ginger Baker, now 73 and still raging.
A juicy slice of rock history.
A fascinating rockumentary that pays tribute to its subject's impressive musical odyssey, while illustrating the enormous emotional costs he's incurred along the way.
By turns sad and darkly comedic, but never less than mesmerizing -- a moving and morally conflicted portrait of a true questing spirit.
This straightforward yet insightful documentary pays tribute to its subject without resorting to hagiography.
I watched Beware of Mr. Baker and longed for the time when rock was good, musicians were gods, and good god, the parties and the playing were species of their own.
