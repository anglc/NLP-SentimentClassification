With dark, compelling components similar to that of The Chaser and Memories of Murder, Confession of Murder feels like a great film wrapped inside of a dreadful one that suffers from disastrous editing and shoddy writing.
The film also fills the screen with spectacular stunt work, set pieces that thrill with both insanity and absurdity, and a generous helping of tension-releasing humor.
