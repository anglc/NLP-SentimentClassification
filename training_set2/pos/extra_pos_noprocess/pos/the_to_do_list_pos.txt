It's good-natured and raucous, with many scenes that are just sketched but a few that are truly funny.
By proudly wearing its "otherness" (a word I use ironically) on its sleeve, The To Do List feels fresh and strange and wondrously new. It shouldn't, but it does.
"The To Do List" doesn't reinvent the wheel; we all know the "summer that changed everything" trope. But it's startling when you realize how rare it is to see a girl chasing sexual experience so doggedly - and with such a lighthearted tone.
This raunchy teen comedy more than earns its R-rating ... but it does so with a lot of heart.
Painfully awkward encounters ensue, with Plaza handling it all with her deadpan elegance.
The jokes are frequent, rapidly fired, and often sharply written, featuring crude sexual dialogue about everything imaginable from masturbation to states of sexual arousal.
While it's too gentle to be a classic, it's still worth a look.
Uneven and with a pretty even hit:miss gag ratio, there is still not-for-Nan fun to be had here.
Maggie Carey's feature film debut is full of lazy shots, duff lines and dodgy acting. But it also contains fresh ideas and hilarious gags.
It has heart and intelligence to offset its more raucous moments and looks destined for cult appeal.
Enjoyable teen sex comedy that gains points for its female perspective and features both strong comic performances and a decent script, despite some of the gags being a bit hit-and-miss.
Even as this comedy strains to be goofy and transgressive, it catches us by surprise simply because it dares to explore first-time sexual experiences through female eyes.
