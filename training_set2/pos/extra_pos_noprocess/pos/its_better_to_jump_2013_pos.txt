A provocative, if lopsided snapshot of the ancient walled city of Acre (or Akka), located on the northwest coast of Israel.
The directors have chosen eloquent interviewees, and the passionate attachment they feel for their city gives the film heart.
The film feels like a work of community advocacy.
Ignore the one obviously Zionist "rotten" below. This is a terrific documentary about the resistance to a vulgar and soulless gentrification of a beautiful and historic old city. The story of Zionist brutality in a microcosm.
The subject is the cultural cannibalization of one of the world's most ancient and beautiful cities, and however one-sided the argument is here, the problem is undeniably moving and true.
A startling documentary about life in Acre, an Israeli city on the sea filled with unhappy Palestinians who have lived there for generations.
