The movie's tongue in cheek humor will buy off most of the target audience. And Arnie? He's indestructible.
Christmas morning. Tiny puppies licking my face. A plate of crispy bacon. The embrace of a loved one. The last forty-five minutes of The Last Stand.
There are echoes here of Howard Hawks' classic 1959 Western Rio Bravo, in which John Wayne played a similarly beleaguered sheriff trying to prevent a jailbreak with the aid of a bunch of misfits.
A throwback action movie that invokes 1980s nostalgia in all the right ways.
The Last Stand is a fast-paced, action-heavy throwback, shot with a fluid visual eye by Kim Jee-Woon. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back and better than ever.
This is the kind of action film you've seen before done better, and while the technological aspects may be more polished than most, the theatrical experience still feels considerably small-screen.
Arnie lurches through the film with a kind of defiant dignity, his signature mixture of self-effacing humour and good ol' tough talk allowing us to buy into the kind of big-screen hero he made us fall in love with all those decades ago.
Director Jee-woon Kim (I Saw the Devil) knows how to fill up the screen, surround his megastar with economy-sized murders, car chases, billowing blood-clouds and goofiness.
Schwarzenegger, now 65, hasn't lost his one amazing gift for being a movie's worst actor and best asset
...it's refreshing to watch a film that wants to be nothing more than a blood-soaked accompaniment to beer and pizza.
The Last Stand sees bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger return to the big screen following an eight-year term as Governor of California, because that is the reality we now occupy... A fun, dumb, enjoyable, dumb, mostly well performed, super dumb film.
Resembling more the 'Austrian Oak' with each passing year, Arnold Schwarzenegger still manages to make a big, bloody fist of the archetypal action-hero in Kim Jee-woon's The Last Stand.
Sensational action, bloody violence, goofy humour and Arnie as the small town Sheriff - it's all there, and the larger than life 65 year old Austrian superstar continues to fill every inch of the screen
Despite some graphic violence and even though it is really silly, this is an entertaining action film showing that Arnold Schwartzenegger has not lost any of his charm.
