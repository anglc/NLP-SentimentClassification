A vital, urgent and infuriating look at the devastating failures of the juvenile court system and the insidious reach of prison privatization.
In his directorial debut, Robert May examines in granular detail the causes and effects of the scandal, and interviewed dozens of people over a number of years.
A carefully measured, admirably precise account of this sordid business.
This provides enough valuable information to constitute a worthy public service announcement.
Without sensationalizing his already scandalous material, Mr. May arranges the contributions of reporters, lawyers and anguished relatives of young offenders into a shocking and impartial portrait of justice denied and childhoods erased.
'Kids for Cash' will scare the wits out of anyone worried about how institutional neglect is affecting our kids.
The film is imperfect in its structure, but director Robert May never sensationalizes what is horrifying enough in its straightforward telling.
Kids for Cash does what any great advocacy doc does: give you the cold hard facts to get you angry and make you want to pay attention so that something like this never happens again.
Its small filmmaking flaws aside, the story of Kids For Cash is a powerful and important one.
While the film has heroes -- this is part of the utility of May's filmmaking -- the conclusions about the juvenile justice system in this country are even more haunting.
That the film showcases the students after these experiences indicates the broader stakes of this story, from the judge's self-delusions to the parents' frustrations to the kids' ongoing struggles.
A new kind of Scared Straight! for the post-Columbine generation.
Adds considerable behind-the-headlines insight . . . despite the frustrating blank holes that are filled with rage against the machine of injustice.
May does a marvelous job laying out this horrific scandal.
An extraordinary feat.
A staggeringly ironic case of misinformed blanket judgment about a man who did the exact same thing.
