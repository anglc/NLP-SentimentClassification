Richard Parry delivers a solid if not revelatory video (2008) about what motivates a man to leave behind a wife and child to risk his life collecting salable images of death.
A fascinating, entertaining and skilfully assembled documentary about the messed up business of war reporting, and the messed up men who do it.
An intriguing documentary.
This is a thoughtful and provocative film unlike anything we've seen. It's also vitally important.
