This well-crafted remake of 1978's 'Patrick' is rich in gothic trappings and features a terrific central performance by Sharni Vinson.
This Ozploitation remake is a spookily effective fright-fest.
[Patrick] is malevolent, but he's also melancholy-the ultimate example of a guy who likes a girl, but try as he might, can't make a move.
More horror remakes should be as thoughtful as "Patrick: Evil Awakens," an atypically clever riff on the 1978 Australian thriller "Patrick."
Against all odds, they've managed to succeed where many efforts fail, returning the tension and peculiarity of the premise for another go-around of telekinetic terror.
The newly capitalised PATRICK is as spookily Gothic and look-out-behind-you! crazy as the original.
reimagined from Richard Franklin's 1978 original as a piece of hysterical high gothic with giallo-esque trimmings (not least the fabulously over-the-top score by Pino Donaggio).
Hartley's remake is extremely faithful to the original, and what is most fun about it is the style and tone ... Donaggio's bold, over-the-top, old-school horror score reminds us that we are in an homage, and to enjoy the ride as such.
Effectively chilly, moody remake of Richard Franklin's 1978 horror classic about a mysterious coma patient, smartly updated for iGen audiences...A skilfully made genre piece, a very satisfying movie meal, well done with a garnish of dark humour.
Hartley understands all too well that a pulpy midnight horror movie can be many things (Fast! Trashy! Outrageous! Over the top!) but it cannot be boring. It cannot be complacent. And it cannot take the audience for granted.
Takes the coolest parts of the original Aussie thriller and adds some more goofy fun.
It's a film that'll be most appreciated by lovers of cinema, especially aficionados of the horror genre - not the new wave but the old school
Pino Donaggio's glorious discordant orchestral score is a standout, making the hairs on the back of our necks stand up, never letting up and always keeping us tightly on the leash. Bloody scary!
Patrick's attempts at terror are more noisy than chilling, but its story is unique and engaging, even if the hairs on your neck never raise to full-mast.
[An] uneven, not particularly scary narrative that nevertheless rewards in its loving embrace of camp excess and well-staged nastiness.
