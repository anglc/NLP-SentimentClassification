Darkly funny and deeply twisted, "13 Sins" grabs you from its startling opening sequence and doesn't let go.
13 Sins is a smart, stylish picture elevated by fine performances by Webber and a superior ensemble of supporting players, including Richard Bower, Ron Perlman, and Pruitt Taylor Vince.
Stamm brings such a deft touch to these tonal transitions that it's hard to believe he directed the dreadful 2010 hit The Last Exorcism.
Flimsy plot withstanding, 13 Sins is an enjoyable watch and fits neatly into the ever expanding genre of film as theme park ride: thrilling, shocking, forgettable.
It's a challenging genre to take on - one in which it's difficult to deliver surprises or present complex characters - but Stamm has acquitted himself well.
13 Sins isn't perfect but will certainly keep you hooked until the bloody denouement.
13 Sins is a tense and thrilling rollercoaster that grabs you just a few minutes in and doesn't let go until its done taking you through its bizarre trip.
The overall effect is enormously amusing. And haunting as well.
Even if the premise is tired, this grim thriller holds the attention by focussing on the raw intensity of the characters' personal lives.
Puts the audience in the position to question what they'd be willing to do, and I think many of us would be shocked at which level our friends might bow out of this game.
An unrepentant horror-thriller, stoked with tension and grim revelations.
