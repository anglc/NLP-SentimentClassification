'Black Rock' is never dull, but it's hardly the attention-grabbing calling card its creator presumably intended.
This is a lean and mean variation on a familiar theme, tense throughout, with some terrific performances.
This indie, female-centric riff on "Deliverance" is spare, smartly written and shot through with moments of twig-snapping tension.
This isn't quite the distaff Deliverance promised, but it's a credible indie thriller with characters worth caring about.
We've seen Duplass write scripts that break cinema conventions like this, but who knew that his actress wife Aselton would turn out to be an equally innovative director?
[An] earthy, woodsy throwback thriller ...
Katie Aselton's survival thriller sets its themes of time's passage, unresolved history and reluctant coming of age within a gripping island-set genre frame. It's like Lord Of The Flies for arrested adults.
First-time filmmaker Aselton creates one of the most assured thrillers in recent memory, throwing finely developed characters into a very nasty situation that makes us squirm in our seats.
Slender, but committed: even Kate Bosworth, as the girls' team leader, forswears her usual lipgloss.
It's Aselton and Bell who really impress, their characters providing the glue of credibility that prevents the increasingly overwrought situation from coming apart.
Engaging, gripping and tightly constructed thriller with a sharp script, effective action sequences and strong performances from all three leads.
A tight-fisted little piece of gender-centric survival horror.
While not exactly the most dangerous game, Black Rock is a decent, punctuated gender battle which flys by quick enough to keep viewers at attention for a predictable yet watchable thriller.
... a feminist reworking of 'Most Dangerous Game' and 'Deliverance,' with the friends soon stripped down and armed, like a tribe of Amazonian huntresses ... has the visceral appeal of early Kathryn Bigelow.
