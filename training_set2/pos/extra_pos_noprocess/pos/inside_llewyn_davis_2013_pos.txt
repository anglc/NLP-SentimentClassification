This is one of the strangest yet most satisfying movie experiences of the year, one of those films in which you can't really appreciate what you've seen until it's over. You just have to trust that the trip is worth the trouble. And it is.
The broad, black humor of the Coens' early features has ripened over the years into a sadder, more philosophical brand of comedy (A Serious Man) that puts them in a class with Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch (yeah, you heard me).
The Coen brothers have crafted another unique period piece.
Celebrating and mourning a bygone moment, "Inside Llewyn Davis" is a tuneful wake intended to arouse us from our slumber to desires worth remembering.
You don't end up rooting for Llewyn Davis because there's not much to root for. And this imparts a weird sort of impersonality or cold-bloodedness to the film's core.
In the end you feel Llewyn's pain even as you realize he is a pain. Llewyn Davis is nobody you'd want to be inside.
It may be the Coen Brothers playing well inside their comfort zone, but what a fine and thoughtful comfort zone it is.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" is one of the best pictures of the year, plain and simple. It's the Coen Brothers finest film since "Fargo."
An underlying sadness gives the film some weight balanced by moments of farce. For Coen fans, it's can't-miss.
Near-comedy, near-tragedy, "Inside Llewyn Davis" is close to great, and in its extremely concrete yet endlessly elusive form, close to perfection.
A beautiful, unassuming, rewarding ache of a movie.
This film's re-creation of 1961 New York feels totally convincing in its shabby, run-down glory and the sense of having a real window back into the past isn't something to be underestimated.
Llewyn's tragedy is the Coens' stroke of genius.
It's not their best-in fact, it hardly even feels like a Coen brothers movie at all-but its majestic musical numbers and fantastic performances elevate this well above the humdrum lesser filmmakers churn out.
Where O Brother's picaresque was all sepia, bluegrass, hayseed slapstick and family reunion, this film offers a stringent voyage of overcast skies, melancholy folk, soured relationships and no direction home.
Musically and visually, Inside Llewyn Davis offers plenty of frictionless pleasures to compensate for the prickly scrappiness of its hero.
The Coens can be so good when they just get over themselves.
A fascinating look at depression, artistry and the struggle of everyone to find a place.
Deftly observed, touchingly melancholy and slyly funny.
The Coen's offbeat sensibility and predilection for leftfield characters is a perfect fit for the world they've chosen to explore.
The music choices alone will ensure this haunting, beautifully detailed film will live a long and lasting life.
Certainly you miss much on first viewing, but so far even a second sitting hasn't quite changed my admiration (great as it is) to affection.
Hilarious in the Coens' weird, askew way, but also absolutely crushing. This movie breaks my heart in a hundred different ways.
It's typically Coen; wit and pathos in equal measure, glazed with colourful characters and pitch-perfect performances, with a soundtrack that perfectly captures the setting.
