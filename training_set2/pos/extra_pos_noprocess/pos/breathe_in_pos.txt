Buoyed by some nicely nuanced performances (especially by Pearce and Amy Ryan as his dream-dashing wife), Breathe In never quite rises above its predictable potboiler premise.
Every moment between stars Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones feels so much like an explosion about to go off that viewers may hesitate to so much as take a breath at the wrong time for fear of disturbing the film's delicate equilibrium.
The superb acting can't turn narrative lead into gold with this story about the attraction of a foreign-exchange student pianist to her married host and teacher.
Midlife crises, affairs, teen drinking, sex in indie drama.
A soft, pretty score and noteworthy camera work -- often close on the actors' hands or faces -- help keep this low-key film engrossing.
The screen sparkles with the sexual tension between Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones...
It takes all of 10 minutes for Doremus' film to reveal itself to us: this is a movie about a conflicted father who has arrived at a crossroads, both morally and artistically.
Pearce and Jones manage to engage in a will-they-or-won't-they pas de deux that at times approaches the intensity of the most white-knuckled thriller.
Breathe In may telegraph where it's going late in the game and these irrational decisions might make for some frustrated viewers, but it is without a doubt one of the most emotionally poignant and heartbreaking movies we saw at Sundance last year.
