A boisterously Tarantinoesque mash-up of cliches, archetypes and bodacious craziness in the tradition of Southern-fried '60s and '70s drive-in fodder.
Although artistically slight and thematically haphazard, it's enjoyably flashy.
I kind of f*****g loved it, all things considered.
While stipulating that at its core it's fairly slight, and also constructed of prefabricated parts, this is a deeply but pleasantly weird sort of Southern Gothic battle royale.
This ode to Tarantino, 'Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!,' and Jerry Lewis marathons is deliriously silly, frenetically violent, and insanely entertaining, especially for those who prefer 'Mad Max' over 'The Rules of the Game.'
