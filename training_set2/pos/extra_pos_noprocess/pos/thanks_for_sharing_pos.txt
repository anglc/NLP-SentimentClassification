After the bleak brilliance of 'Shame,' this is an almost sunny look at sexual addiction. Almost.
Writer/director Stuart Blumberg got me to care about the characters and their fate to a degree all too rare in medium-sized American dramas.
A likeable, well-meaning muddle of a movie, Thanks For Sharing takes the light road through the serious sex addiction of three New Yorkers.
Engaging, low-key and thoughtful comedy-drama with a sharply observed script and a trio of terrific performances from Ruffalo, Robbins and Gad.
Tonally the film is all over the rink, but it leaves you more convinced and entertained than you'd expect.
Even if we've never been to a 12-step meeting, an intelligent script and sharp performances help us see ourselves in these characters and situations.
It's a romantic comedy about sex addiction but somehow it pulls off the premise. Director Stuart Blumberg takes some unlikely material for the genre and makes it work.
