Morris. Hawking. Two of my favorite artists together. It couldn't miss, and it didn't.
[The film has] a sophisticated agenda that's more about association than data or personal trivia, and Morris' philosophy takes it to places a conventional documentary could never go.
A really fun ride.
It's accessible, informative and entertaining.
A capable documentary, but the title's misleading. It's more about Hawking himself than the book this docu takes its name from.
