Page's natural beauty, charisma and genuine sense of fun - not to mention her 36-24-37 measurements - come clearly through in Mori's tale.
The best thing about this documentary portrait of the beloved 1950s pin-up is its meaty narration, courtesy of Page herself, speaking in the low, slightly gravelly register of an aging Southern belle.
The film offers frank, matter-of-fact commentary that is far more illuminating than the talking-head encomiums served up by the likes of Perez Hilton, Dita Von Teese, and Hugh Hefner.
The film's reason for being, though, is the sound of Page's voice -- a worldly, aged Southern drawl -- as she recounts her life story from childhood through retirement.
A scintillating, sincere and empathetic portrait of the pinup queen who attained her greatest influence as an icon of female sexuality decades after she retired.
Bettie Page Reveals All is an excellent amalgamation of the history of Page and her incredible impact on modeling and fashion, mostly told in her own voice.
