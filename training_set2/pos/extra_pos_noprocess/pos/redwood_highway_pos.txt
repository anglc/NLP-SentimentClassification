The mostly gentle drama has integrity without feeling caught up in its own nobility.
While this road movie may not have great originality or huge box-office potential, it's a low-key charmer with a large-souled performance at its center.
The script (by director Gary Lundgren with James Twyman) is modestly feel-good to a fault and the scenery expectedly beautiful, but it's the unforced acting providing the most nourishment.
Solid acting overcomes a lack of dynamic tension in this family-friendly film.
worth the trip to appreciate the acting
Shirley Knight gives a winning lead performance, and the film captures the beauty of Southern Oregon landscapes.
Knight shines in this contemplative, unrushed road movie on foot, with a rare, respectful focus on the existential despair of an older woman. And a solitary journey that is a female take on voyaging through those woods that are lovely, dark and deep.
A road-trip movie that takes its time, with an enjoyable ramble through the beautiful woods of southern Oregon, 'Redwood Highway' is a character study of a determined, if sometimes perplexed, woman.
