At once a spoof of, and loving tribute to, '70s-era visions of the future, Space Station 76 nods to 2001 in numerous ways.
This may look like a wacky spoof of 1970s sci-fi, but Jack Plotnick's beautifully designed comedy-drama actually has a lot more on its mind.
"Space Station 76" stretches every penny, from the curving white walls of the station to the men's wide-collared shirts, but it also demonstrates the kind of talentand determination that no amount of money can buy a filmmaker who doesn't have them.
While enthralled with its own retro-futuristic trappings at heart, this is a pitch-black dramedy with a mean-streak.
Even with the melodrama and comedic elements, there's a deep sense of sincerity to performances happening on-screen.
The script never quite matches the laser-sighted wit of the visuals.
It's not a movie that will appeal to everyone's sensibilities, but if you like your comedy clever and subtle with a heaping of great character exploration, this one's for you.
Daringly changes tone, and challenges expectation, without ever missing the beat. The acting and the design are consistently spot-on in their homage to the '70s, but it's smarter and deeper than the gag-fest you might expect.
It's almost as hard to hate Space Station 76 as it is to recommend it without an apologetic grin.
It never seems to be mocking its characters. It feels for them. Sometimes its heart breaks for them.
Turns out to be quite poignant in its examination of loneliness and dissatisfaction.
Space Station 76 plays it dry, often a bit too dry. It's a film of many chuckles and few big laughs. When the laughs do come, they're considerable.
It's unexpected and intelligent, and well worth discovering.
