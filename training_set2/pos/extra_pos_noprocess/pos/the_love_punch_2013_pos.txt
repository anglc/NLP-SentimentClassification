A good-natured if strenuously wacky caper comedy about a divorced British couple who plot a diamond heist to save their pensions.
The jokes are as creaky as the would-be robbers' ageing bodies, but Thompson's air of wry disdain and Brosnan's frisky playfulness are enormously winning.
A delightful, breezy and outrageously funny slice of mindless entertainment with a charming cast.
A heist-caper comedy with Emma Thomson and Pierce Brosnan as a winsome couple on a grand adventure to recover their love and much more.
Critics - and viewers - will either huffily reject all this nonsense out of hand, wondering how such intelligent, quick-witted performers...could stoop to this level of moviemaking. Or, they'll take a deep breath, relax, and go with it.
