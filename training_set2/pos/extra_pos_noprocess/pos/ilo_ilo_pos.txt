Chen builds his case not with sentimentality and obvious plot points, but through everyday life -- showering, doing laundry, dropping the boy off at school, phone calls.
The crowded compositions convey a sense of life in the dense Asian city-state, but also the intimacy of this semi-autobiographical story.
Anthony Chen, a Singaporean writer-director with a half-dozen shorts to his credit, makes his feature debut with this vividly characterized domestic drama.
Characters who may seem hopeless begin to suggest a vulnerable side, and none truly deserve the situations that afflict them.
"Ilo Ilo" is writer-director Anthony Chen's first film, but breathtaking intimacy in storytelling is already second nature to him.
The acting is terrific, as is the attention to detail.
A low-key gentle observant family drama that resonates emotionally with intimacy.
Thankfully never sentimental, and wisely resisting an easy, happy ending, Ilo Ilo is a surprisingly satisfying import.
The midsection's a little flabby, forcing us to wait for certain plot elements to line up before the third act can begin, but on the whole this is a solid transition from shorts to feature-length storytelling.
That Ilo Ilo is set 10 years before the global financial crisis gives it a small, sad, prophetic power.
This quiet little domestic drama from Singapore reminds us films can achieve near-impossible heights and depths of intimacy and empathy.
It's a simple, straightforward, character-driven drama, reminiscent of the American indies that made their mark during the 1990s.
With evocative performances, especially from the two women, and a nicely modulated sense of nostalgia, "Ilo Ilo" marks the emergence of a promising new cinematic voice.
This sympathetic and engaging drama is deceptively gentle in its insight - compassionate yet unsentimental.
Low on feel-good pizzazz but absolutely brimming with love and respect.
A lovely, intimate drama of family dynamics under stress, offering an intriguing peek into previously unseen Singaporean middle-class life.
Anthony Chen puts modern Singaporese cinema on the map with this beautifully observed and gently comic family drama.
Chen scurries his handheld camera around the apartment and neighbouring streets like a tyro Truffaut. He could be making Les Quatre cent coos.
Ilo Ilo is filled with sweetness, humour and humanity: so assured and accomplished that it's hard to believe this is a first feature.
A smart, engaging, universal drama.
Not all magically benevolent nannies fly on talking umbrellas, as we learn in this beautifully formed little heart-tugger.
