"Locke" is one riveting film.
For the most part, it works like gangbusters.
The crises Ivan Locke faces with a tremendous will to do the right thing strike a chord. The mistakes that have him in the driver's seat, but hardly in control, are terribly human and all too familiar.
Knight's strength is his writing, and arguably, Locke would be almost as good set on a stage with a man sitting on a chair. But then you'd miss the details of Hardy's face in a film that is all about an actor's vehicle.
A man, a car, a hands-free mobile device. And it is extraordinary.
Hardy does sterling work in evoking the shifting balance of self-loathing [and] pride in doing the right thing... As an exercise in pure character building, it's a great one.
The film makes quite a lot out of not very much, and features a strong performance from Tom Hardy, whose versatility continues to impress - and for that it's worth checking out.
This is pure storytelling and acting and it is magnificent, compelling and wonderful.
Locke is an original and impressive experience, an unusual film of considerable quality.
Knight's structural experiment, its willingness to embrace chaos, and its ultimate emotional impact make it one of the most outstanding movies of the year so far.
In this car ... an entire story is richly told, whole characters are indelibly portrayed with nuance, ambiguity, precision, foibles, heroics and devastations, and we are thoroughly engaged, carried along as by the superior mechanisms of Locke's Mercedes.
"Locke" is NOT a thrill ride. But, it is compelling.
Fabulous, mesmerising one-man movie, Tom Hardy puts in a tour de force performance [as] a man desperate not to submit to desperation.
This is not 2014's most inviting movie experience, but it will stand as one of the year's most successful movie experiments.
The screenplay by writer-director Steven Knight ("Eastern Promises") shows a keen insight into the psychology of the sons of alcoholic fathers. Tom Hardy, one of the best actors working today, shows his versatility in this subtle performance.
You would not think a film in which a man simply drives at night from Birmingham to London could possibly be gripping, but Tom Hardy proves spellbindingly hypnotic in this decidedly unusual road movie.
A masterful performance from Tom Hardy ensures this one-man show is enthralling from beginning to end.
It is well-written and professionally constructed and guided by a powerful performance by Hardy, who is starting to become one of the most promising actors of his generation.
If there has been a better cautionary tale for men since Fatal Attraction, I can't think of it, but Locke is about more than fidelity. It's a thriller about the horrors of modern life. All that technology, but who can save him?
I think Steven Knight's done a terrific job of direction. It's a very intelligent, very austere film.
It is the most extraordinary feat this film, and it's not just an exercise in pyrotechnics, it's an exploration of existential angst.
For a movie set entirely inside a car, Locke is an impressive and engaging feat.
Hardy's introspective intensity helps to achieve and sustain and level of intimacy that's more thrilling than many films with 100 times the budget.
Knight's clever, tight screenplay and Hardy's tour de force performance collaborate to create a constantly captivating and even suspenseful film.
