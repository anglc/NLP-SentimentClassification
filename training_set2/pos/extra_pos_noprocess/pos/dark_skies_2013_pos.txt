Dark Skies is sort of supernatural, but it's really more super natural....[it's] about the fragility of family, a muted meditation on how precious it is.
Those elements are employed with consummate dexterity.
Sneaks by being a retread, mainly because of the really thick tension and suspense [the director] pulls off with an effective score and sharp direction.
Dark Skies may not be a revelatory experience, but as a pure exercise in genre filmmaking, it excels.
Dark Skies won't totally scratch that itch for a good scare, but it's a welcome treat for those who follow the old X-Files credo, "The truth is out there".
When writer-director Scott Stewart eventually reveals his hand, the film loses its way, but Hamilton and Russell's solidly convincing performances keep things more grounded than you might expect.
Dark Skies unveils its horror slowly, creating a suspenseful ride that feels satisfying even though we're traveling a familiar road.
...the film, for the most part, contains many elements that have been employed in other similarly-themed endeavors...
The movie promises fireworks--and it delivers.
What body-snatches this beyond being another haunted-home flick is the attention to family breakdown rather than another scare around the next dark corner. It's more about eerieness and creepiness than outlandish confrontations and gory shocks.
It's never uninteresting.
A moderately effective supernatural tale, an allegory for our anxious times in which a suburban American family appears to be targeted by some malign force that is, as we used to say, "not of this world".
An old-fashioned scary movie; a sci-fi horror that is a workmanlike piece of film-making, with some effective shocks, cheerfully borrowing from other sources, most obviously Spielberg.
Dark Skies is a good story, well told and one that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
