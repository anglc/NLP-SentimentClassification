The film succeeds in reflecting the weird sweetness in Pepitone.
This loving portrait of the angst-ridden comedian should well lift his profile.
The film's unvarying lack of drama or direction can be wearing, but the schlubby originality of its subject fully repays the longueurs.
By turns robustly amusing and wistfully melancholy.
Eddie Pepitone, perhaps the funniest stand-up comedian you've never heard of, gets a deserving close-up in the amusing, freewheeling documentary "The Bitter Buddha."
The Bitter Buddha strains a little too hard for dramatic heft, but it's nevertheless a compelling, sweet, funny valentine to a comic's comic and a true American original.
Half successful standup comic Eddie Pepitone expands the screen from stage to life as he lives his part 24 hours a day.
An enjoyable lighthearted watch about someone you want to root for to succeed.
It's a solid doc.
Few comics with this degree of rage have been this self-aware and comical about it. He's a fascinating blend of NYC anger and L.A. trends. He's a wannabe vegan with road rage. 'Nuff said.
Engaging, revealing and even a bit moving.
This is a portrait of an interesting and endearing misanthrope, but someone who we all know lives inside of us. Eddie's just more willing to put it all out there, to express that existential angst most modern people experience.
As raucous, crass and furiously delightful as the subject's stand-up comedy.
Pepitone has a caustic yet engaging personality, and the film pays tribute to its subject while capturing what makes him unique.
