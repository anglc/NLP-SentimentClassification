There is plenty of footage of Hetherington. So much, you wonder if he wanted to leave a part of himself behind should the worst come to the worst.
Sebastian Junger, who worked with Hetherington on the celebrated doc Restrepo, paints a biographical profile that often speaks eloquently to the unique nature both of his late friend and of war itself.
Junger ... brings intimacy and personal insight to his film but doesn't give into the temptation to make it a eulogy.
The film is more powerful and haunting thanks to the ample footage incorporated of Hetherington himself, a cheerful soul even when faced with evidence of unimaginable cruelty, such as photographing those blinded during the war in Liberia.
It's easy to see how inspiring he could be as an artist, and how tragically addictive the insanity of combat becomes when the engagement and desire to understand run that deep.
His desire to understand conflict, his gnawing away at the question of what young men get out of violence, sets our own brain whirring.
There is a sense of intimacy and a warm humanity shining in all his work and this is an eloquent, moving tribute ...
With its conventional archive-plus-talking-heads format, this film is less radical than , but Junger articulates a number of subtle and unexpected ideas about Hetherington's work, and about combat reporting in general.
One imagines the charismatic Hetherington, once met, would be unforgettable: Junger's film is a decent, heartfelt tribute.
A stirring lament for the late, great photojournalist and some-time film director who was killed in action.
This is chiefly a celebratory piece ... It is more than that, however, shedding light on what it means to be a journalist in a war zone.
Unsurprisingly, considering the circumstances, this is less a meticulous study of photojournalist's art than an privileged and emotional look at the life of a friend and colleague.
Hetherington's portrait-like approach to his subjects is itself a form of cinema.
..mostly a biographical film, honoring the man and his work ... while also highlighting two questions often ignored in discussions of war and war photography.
A warm, fitting capstone for a man who saw the best in people during some of the worst circumstances, and helped notably reshape notions of war photography.
