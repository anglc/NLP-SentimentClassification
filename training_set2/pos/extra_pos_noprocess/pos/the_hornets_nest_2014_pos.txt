A vivid up-close view of the travails of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Mr. Boettcher knew those men, puts faces to their names. As he says, every soldier's story is different, and they all bear telling.
"The Hornet's Nest" is a kinetic, immersive experience, particularly in its deeply felt human moments.
It's a thrilling you-are-there war movie, with incredible images from the middle of firefights, mixed with the story of a father and son trying to reconnect.
The moving documentary The Hornet's Nest is a boots-on-the-ground look at America's war in Afghanistan.
We're not suggesting that this film is going to drive A-list actors and directors out of the war-movie business. But The Hornet's Nest might push them to change what they do in the name of realism.
The result isn't as cumulatively powerful as intended, but it remains politically even-handed and offers some immersive insight along the front lines.

The Hornet's Nest is a powerful movie that shows what really happens on the ground during a conflict like this, and it's very apropos to view around Memorial Day.
