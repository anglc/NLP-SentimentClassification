Even in a work of science fiction like this, Gleeson seems beyond real. All those foam-faces being made in the dark? They're for him.
Some people will revel in this warm front of innocence; others will reach for their Voltaire.
You may as well check your cynicism at the door, because Curtis & Co. are going to find a way to trample all over it - adorably.
"It's just so overflowing with ideas and characters that the main point it's trying to make nearly eludes it."
The film matures from a mere romcom into something older and wiser, as Tim and his dad have some heart-to-hearts that end up becoming lessons for all of us in how to live.
Richard Curtis' movies are classics but this one is not.
If it feels like the mangled adaptation of a much richer and more rewarding novel, almost everything that is frustrating about the film is also counterbalanced by moments of thoughtfulness and insightfulness.
There are those who, upon finding a plot hole in a film, allow it to ruin the movie. I'm not among them.'About Time' is flawed, with numerous plot holes. But it's beautifully told, wonderfully acted and touching enough to bring viewers to tears.
This complete charmer of a movie delighted me from start to finish. In fact, About Time may well be the two most purely pleasurable hours I've spent in the cinema all year.
In the end, it's a charmer. For those of you who have liked Curtis' previous rom-coms, come along for a lovely joyride...
Akin to a children's novel (the sort where the shadow of death fuzzily looms), About Time turns into a successfully sentimental family film in the literal sense of the term.
Typical Richard Curtis fare, with a time travel twist.
Brilliantly written and well directed by Curtis (this is his third film behind the camera), "About Time" is just another jewel in his crown as the reigning romantic comedy king.
It's about time so it's a bit convoluted. It's too long but not a bad rom-com.
No director/writer has shown a better understanding of the multi-faceted aspects of love than Richard Curtis.
"About Time" uses an ingenious and original comic device, built around the most irresistible commodity any movie can offer...
About Time is a solid tale about love, loss, and family with great performances - that leans on a compelling but sometimes problematic time-travel premise.
It's sweet and charming and utterly preposterous and, despite the trailers, it's not as much of a love story as you might think. Or at least, not that kind of love story.
Sci-fi freshens the formula, and the actors sail away on the new possibilities.
It's smart and sweet and unabashedly sentimental. But it's also the kind of movie that - in spite of its faults - strikes a bright, resonant wind-chime of a note.
