Thankfully there are enough eloquent talking heads to keep this watchable.
A slight, but very satisfying, and at times, surprisingly moving, documentary about the inescapable Jewish anthem and wedding and bar mitzvah music staple.
An entertaining examination of the "kitschy and profound" song's cultural and historical origins.
It's a fun, nostalgic, informative journey.
The attitude is so much fun and the story so involving that a little naches is forgivable.
Even the occasional bad jokes feel like part of this story.
The film is alternately fascinating and entertaining, though you'll likely be sick of hearing the familiar melody by the time it's through.
You know you're in for an irreverent documentary when the narrator asks: "What's up with this song?"
The film isn't slick and doesn't have the greatest production values I've ever seen, but it's still an enjoyable romp through the history of a great song.
A whimsical and even occasionally profound documentary about the origins of this time-honoured Jewish tune.
It is annoying, frustrating, embarrassing, and irresistible, which makes it a perfect Rorschach test and intriguing metaphor for contemporary Jewish identity.
What does it mean? Do we really care? We should.
Balancing the anecdotal with the informative, this charming docu at once celebrates and explains the origins of the iconic Jewish tune.
As one interviewee says the song "is a melody that evokes new life, hope, and joy." The song does that and so does HAVA NAGILA (THE MOVIE).
Fun and illuminating...The movie as well as the song serve as fitting, entertaining testaments to the resilience of the Jewish people.
Entertainingly traces the origins of the ubiquitous song and how it became worldwide kitsch [but] gets wearyingly redundant like a party that has gone on too long.
Everything you ever wanted to know about Hava Nagila but were afraid to ask, except:: 'What's the deal with the ritual of raising a chair in the air like you don't care?'
One of those rare, crowd-pleasing documentaries that compels you to tap your toes and leaves you with a great big smile on your face from ear to ear upon exiting the theater.
