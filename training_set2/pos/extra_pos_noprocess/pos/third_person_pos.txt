Even if the story begins to melt into itself, at the end it's still fascinating to watch Haggis move his players.
Plumbing emotional depths, Haggis turns the characters' tribulations onto the viewer: If white is the color of trust -- as Neeson's author writes -- aren't we all a little gray?
Haggis tips his hand too obviously while delivering his narrative sleights and feints, and he piles on the symbolism rather blatantly, too, but his actors are so compelling that the film's individual scenes mostly come off.
In its lesser moments, the film seems as banal and manipulative as any afternoon TV soap. Another way of looking at the film is as Haggis's own very idiosyncratic and intimate essay.
Everything gets just too damn convoluted for its own good, and it's hard to care what becomes of Haggis' characters as they're shifted around.
There are moments when this three-strand drama almost ascends to the emotional resonance of writer-director Paul Haggis' Oscar-winning 2004 movie Crash.
