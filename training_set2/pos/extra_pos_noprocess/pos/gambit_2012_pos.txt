Firth demonstrates flawless comic timing and a knack for gentle slapstick during many sequences that might have bombed with another actor playing Harry Deane.
The right level of farce, tasteful nudity and general shenanigans for the film to not outstay its welcome, while admittedly not lingering long in the memory.
It's a fair comedy that's inoffensive and evocative of a different era, filled with enough eccentricity and sharp delivery to embrace as pleasant nonsense from two screenwriters exceptionally skilled with such buffoonery.
Remade from a 1966 romp starring Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine, this con artist action-comedy is enjoyably silly but never much more than that.
Against odds the film is sometimes funny, bandying its dated tropes like a badge of pride.
