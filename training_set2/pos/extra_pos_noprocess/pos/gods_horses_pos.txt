Anyone seeking to establish an incubator for suicide bombers could hardly improve on Sidi Moumen, a slum on the fringe of Casablanca.
"Horses of God" is one of the most forceful entries in a growing body of cinema that interrogates the causes and effects of terrorism, nationalism and fundamentalism in the Arab world.
Director Nabil Ayouch does a remarkable job of putting you inside this brutal world, from the garbage dumps that serve as playgrounds to soaring aerial shots of the endless tin roofs that form their neighborhood.
Ayouch film casts a sharp gaze on tragedy, and the larger socio-economic issues that beget fanaticism.
A compelling contemplation of the roots of Islamic terrorism in poverty and hopelessness.
Ayouch depicts the sprawling, ramshackle Sidi Moumen slums with fluid camera movements, some of which ascend unexpectedly from street level to the rooftops, the apparent result of cameras on remote-controlled aircraft.
Years-long grooming provides explanatory social context. . .in how marginalized kids . . .get caught up in organized violence to get a sense of control over powerless lives.
Quietly powerful, haunting, unflinchingly honest and character-driven.
Nabil Ayouch's film allows us see how young suicide bombers--"horses of God," as the man in charge of their mission calls them--might deserve our pity.
Horses Of God does a creditable job of depicting the sort of toxic environment that breeds terrorists, gradually divesting its young men of any real hope for their future.
