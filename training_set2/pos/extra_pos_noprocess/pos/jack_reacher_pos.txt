There is a dogged leanness to Reacher's pursuit that lifts his adventures from the generic rut ...
If Cruise's fantasy superhero garners as many staunch fans ... we may be witnessing the birth of a new franchise.
Usually McQuarrie keeps things light, letting us enjoy the fantasy of one man defending himself against five enemies with nothing but his fists.
Christopher McQuarrie's Jack Reacher is that rare blend of hard-hitting action and smooth-talking dialogue that makes for an entertaining film.
McQuarrie deftly intermixes observations on human nature - aware that in life, as in all great mysteries, people are not so easily described as "killer" and "victim." Part of why you root for Jack Reacher is his empathy for these foibles and follies.
A violent adaptation of the bestselling novels about an Iraq War veteran turned vigilante investigator.
...a better-than-average modern-day thriller that hopefully marks the start of a promising new series.
Cruise may be getting older, but he's still the best action star in Hollywood. "Jack Reacher" is typical of the kind of smart choices he's making these days. We could really use more films like this one.
'Jack Reacher' is a lot smarter than you've been led to believe by the ads.

(Cruise)... is assisted by a fine supporting cast that includes, besides Pike, Jenkins and Herzog, David Owelolo, Jai Courtney and Cruise's old buddy, the great Robert Duvall who, at age 81, continues to amaze.
Unless you cast Yao Ming as Bilbo Baggins, what bearing does height have on a characterisation? Thank Christ that Cruise has an unwavering sense of self, as Jack Reacher is old school action dynamite.
Ultimately, the film rises and falls on Cruise's aggressively magnetic performance.
