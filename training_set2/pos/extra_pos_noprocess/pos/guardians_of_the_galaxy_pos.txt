Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy Guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first Star Wars to mind.
Chris Pratt, overflowing with charisma, plays the leader of the pack of misfits, and his blissed-out space cowboy (with a love for seventies music) is so full of good will that he buoys the film and its requisite whizbang special effects.
Director and co-writer James Gunn brings a giddiness and a wondrous, endless sense of why-the-hell-not? possibility that's reminiscent of Star Wars.
Pratt is their prime asset for turning the comedy up to 11. With him playing Star-Lord, you never question what Quill brings to the team: a sparkling, cracked esprit de corps.
The screenplay does an exceptional job of incorporating this film into the pre-existing and percolating Marvel cinematic universe.
With its fantastic ensemble of characters and great sense of humor (not to mention an incredible soundtrack), it rises above the standard formula to make an entertaining and thrilling ride that leaves a lasting impression.
An exhilarating delight-a tongue-in-cheek, big-budget sci-fi blockbuster that could easily be this generation's Star Wars.
Guardians bounces with the energy of pure invention.
There's enough liveliness in the cast and director Gunn's brisk pacing that, at its best, the movie's energy emulates the go-for-it glee of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.
Gunn has done a marvelous job of character development with a large cast of unknown comic-book roles.
Larger-than-life and dangerously explosive, they're so funny that boys and girls will love the film in equal measure.
Once again, we get an against-the-odds, mid-air battle among exploding skyscrapers and fleeing extras. But it's beautifully realised in eye-popping 3D.
There are obvious touchstones here in Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but Gunn allows his influences to inform rather than define the film.
A vibrantly exciting, immensely entertaining and frequently hilarious sci-fi adventure.
Fun and fresh, Guardians Of The Galaxy is another winner from Marvel, and further proof of a very old dictum: you've got to gamble big to win big.
Throughout this technical haze, Guardians carries forth with more spirit than anything Marvel has put out to date.
Guardians Of The Galaxy is deliriously, insanely its own thing, possessed of an idiosyncratic, intimate sense of humour and a magnificently diverse cast, all of whom find exactly the right tone of low-key commitment. Everything fits.
Guardians of the Galaxy is just an obscene amount of fun.
