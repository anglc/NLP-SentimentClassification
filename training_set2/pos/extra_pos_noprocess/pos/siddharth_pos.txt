Though at times "Siddharth" can resemble a well-photographed report on India's social and economic ills, Mehta subtly employs different styles to sustain the poetry, poignancy, and drama.
"Siddharth" provides something more valuable than a tidy resolution: a glimpse of the complicated nature of life a world away.
Like Vittorio De Sica's "The Bicycle Thief," the film uses downbeat themes to make a point about this particular society and life in general.
A spare, lean, and decidedly unsettling account of the ugly reality of child labor and child abduction in India.
Part of what makes "Siddharth" so troubling and moving is the difficulty we have situating our sympathies.
It all feels very real.
Powerful family drama.
By any fair measure, Siddharth is a very good example of world cinema, offering us a window into a world we would not otherwise see. But be cautioned: it is not exactly an "up" film.
By the end, it feels like you're the only one who helped carry Mahendra's horrifying burden in a heavily-populated country.
There's not a hint of melodrama here, and the tale is all the more compelling for it. For a film set half a world away, Siddharth hits very close to home.
The performances are splendid.
A stirring central performance caps a modest yet moving slice of a life fictionalised in its details but real in its sorrow.
It's a sophisticated neo-realist film, beautifully shot and edited to reflect the sense of time and resignation in Indian culture.
Propelled by a hauntingly beautiful music score, Richie Mehta's film about a missing 12 year old boy and the father who searches for him is profoundly sad, as it reveals disturbing truths.
A modern-day neo-realistic fable and genuine spiritual journey. Beautifully shot and acted. See this.
"Siddharth" is a well directed, written, acted and photographed film that should appeal beyond India with its universal story about a father's love for his son.
Writer/director/editor Richie Mehta ("Amal") has created a modern day "Bicycle Thieves" with this devastating tale of an illiterate man trying to find his son with next to nothing to go on amidst the teaming masses of India.
The film never feels less than utterly real in its depiction of both everyday Indian life and the hopelessness that comes so naturally in this sort of tragic situation.
Not the easiest sit, but Siddharth rewards the brave with a study of pained determination and portrait of Indian life that offers a few surprises.
Such a movie is a rare and elusive thing.
