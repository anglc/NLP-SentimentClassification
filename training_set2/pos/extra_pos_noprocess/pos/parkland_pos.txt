This episodic drama is set in Dallas during the three days after the JFK assassination, and some of it is highly charged.
Parkland is history as existential despair.
A ( ... ) pragmatic, four-day, fly-on-the-wall view of Dallas when the 20th Century's most documented death arguably facilitated the birth of 24-hour rolling news, citizen journalism and You Tube.
Parkland is a movie of simple motives. It doesn't waste time with pomp or theory, and the material is acted by those who connect with the characters like reflections in the mirror.
While not bound for classic status, the film still manages to capture a moment in time that changed our country.
The revelations are unshowy, the emotional clout is stealthy, and JFKologists can rest easy knowing that the project neither engages with nor contradicts their pet preoccupations.
A sad tale well told.
Kennedy's death is dramatically reflected via the emergency room emotions.
It does lose a sense of narrative urgency after the grisly demise of Kennedy but fascinates to the end.
It's a heartfelt, modest and well staged film about the Kennedy assassination ...
Parkland dissects the unfolding drama with the cool blade of an autopsy. Red-hot conspiracy theories are diffused in favour of cold hard facts, making this less compelling drama and more frigid reconstruction.
Engaging, well made drama that adds a number of intriguing, never-before-seen perspectives to the JFK assassination, though the general approach frequently means that the characters feel under-developed.
Parkland is the most lucid dramatisation of the tragedy to come out of Hollywood yet.
