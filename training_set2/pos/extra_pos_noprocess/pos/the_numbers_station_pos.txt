With Cusack's help, Barfoed holds your interest without resorting to car chases, a rarity in a contemporary thriller.
Danish director Kasper Barfoed, who makes his English-language debut here, makes fine use of the movie's tight constraints, painting it in concrete hallways, electrical panels, and glowing computer screens.
The claustrophobic location gives the film a clammy suspense, though it's so dimly lit that it's sometimes hard to work out who is shooting at whom.
John Cusack is back in a ferocious spy role updated to the information universe. Look out.
John Cusack's usual clipped way of talking serves him well in the role of a disillusioned black ops agent. He's also convincing in the film's gunplay sequences and in his guarded interaction with others.
The Numbers Station is a lean, tactile thriller that grabs you from the opening and keeps you aptly entertained.
Assembled from competent elements and featuring more dedicated performances than one might expect, The Numbers Station is still a tad too nondescript to leave much of an impact.
