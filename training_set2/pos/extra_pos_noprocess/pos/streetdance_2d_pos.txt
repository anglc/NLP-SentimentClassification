Boutella shows promise beyond her day job as one of Madonna's dancers but otherwise speaking parts are sensibly limited to those who can act.
When the provocative rhythms of Latin fuse with funky street-dancing, the result is sexy, visceral and exciting. Sofia Boutella is a sensation; watching her dance is sure to drive young men to distraction.
The 3D is moderately imaginative...
The story is even flimsier than before, but the dancing is even more electrifying... The vibrant choreography fuses hip-hop hustle and Latin sensuality and the climactic dance number is so cool it raises goosebumps.

An eye-popping and vibrant coming together of super-sexy salsa and spectacular, stylish street dance makes for a fun and entertaining bit of 3D cinema.
In this worthy successor, it's once again the dancing that counts, and this sure-fire crowd-pleaser delivers sensational high-energy routines to some great pop hits.
Streetdance 2 has brash energy; it does not neglect to do what it says on the tin and the lack of realism is no problem.

Although essentially a series of genuinely impressive dance set pieces linked by no more than adequate dramatic interludes, this scores thanks to its sly acknowledgment that street dance can take itself a little too seriously.
