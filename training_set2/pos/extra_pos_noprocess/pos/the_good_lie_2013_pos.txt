The main characters are played by actual refugees-two of whom were child soldiers-and their uninflected, authoritative performances compensate for the feel-good simplifications of Margaret Nagle's script.
A well-told tale that illuminates the experiences of the 20,000 "lost boys" (and girls) of Sudan, with such grace, insight and humor, it can be forgiven a few simplifying liberties taken in the name of moving the narrative along.
If a moviegoer can't cry for the great tragedy of these Sudanese children, and be touched by their small victories, then who on earth deserves our tears and cheers?
It's often earnest to a fault and fearful of its deeper, darker implications. Still, you won't leave The Good Lie unmoved. Its heart really is in the right place,
Director Philippe Felardeau finds some extraordinary landscapes here. And his camera also lingers over his characters' faces, striking maps of their pain, their hunger, their loss.
A fascinating look at what happened to many Sudanese refugees, but also at how people who come from underprivileged parts of the world experience the United States.
Benefits from Reece Witherspoon's understated performance. ..a gentle giant and beautifully restrained film.
This glossy dramatization of the Lost Boys story at least keeps the focus on its Sudanese subjects while relegating the roles of the well-intentioned Americans to those of facilitators instead of saviors.
Charismatic leads and a good heart prove enough for tale of Lost Boys
A moving and haunting script --- also a funny one, at times.
It's a very good film, with some genuinely poignant moments.
These are performances that blur the line between acting and being.
"The Good Lie," for all its sincerity, has a slick, produced quality to it, a Hollywood sensibility that it simply cannot shake off.
One of the smartest choices in "The Good Lie" is to acknowledge that Witherspoon's Carrie has as much to learn from the Sudanese as they do from her.
Has more truth than expected.
If a measure of tasteful restraint is detectable, it serves at least to allow for the depiction of human emotion instead of the market-driven blandification of history.
quite contrary to traditional Hollywood standards, the film does not approach a story about the Third World through the eyes of a Western protagonist, but rather through the eyes of those who live the story directly
Although it falters when it strays from the immigrant perspective, The Good Lie is an undeniably powerful drama, rooted in authentic performances from its four main actors.
Reese Witherspoon may receive top billing and be the star plastered larger-than-life on the posters, but scripter Margaret Nagle and director Philippe Falardeau steadfastly keep their attention where it belongs, on three of The Lost Boys of Sudan.
The strengths of "The Good Lie" are its lack of adherence to convention, its selective use of its nominal star and its decision to dwell on the Sudanese transplants' struggles and triumphs.
The film belongs to three actors you've never heard of, but if putting Witherspoon's mug on the poster is what it takes to get people to go see it, then that's a good lie.
