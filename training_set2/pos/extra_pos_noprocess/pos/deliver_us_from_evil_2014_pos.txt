A surprisingly strong cast and solid direction make all the malarkey in this horror flick tolerable.
A police procedural cake pan [filled] with horror-genre cake batter. It [delivers] troubling questions about evils committed by humankind and ... evils done by something else.
Although it has all the elements it does sport too many horror tropes as though the filmmaker doesn't have the power of his own convictions to boldly go where he hasn't gone before.
It's a genre rollercoaster ride - templated, repetitive and unoriginal, full of ups and downs but nonetheless effective at the one job it's trying to do - make you jump and squeal.
