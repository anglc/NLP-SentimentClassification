Traditional bluegrass songs of loss and grief provide the inspiration and score for this innovative Belgian, Flemish-language musical drama.
It's the music that really brings Broken Circle to life, an excellent collection of old-timey country classics and originals that reconnects the broken bits of the story and resonates with its deepest emotions.
Invigorating musical elements and the lead actors' potent chemistry can't entirely protect this tragic relationship drama from its encroaching shortage of subtlety.
Breakdown's less convincingly scripted second half sputters more often than it shines.
More so than its music, Broken Circle's greatest merit are the compelling performances Van Groeningen cultivates from both his leads.
I wish the patience and grace of the director's techniques in the film's strongest non-musical moments were matched in his depictions of the amazing music on display.
It's a film about a couple whose tumultuous relationship is severely challenged, and the performances are excellent.
Where the Coen brothers gently mocked th[e] music in O Brother Where art Thou?, this plucky little Belgian film reconnects that music to the sorrows that produced it. Just brilliant.
There are plenty of touching, powerful moments in director Felix Van Groeningen's child-with-cancer drama...though [it's] somewhat laboured. The 2012 French film Declaration of War dealt with a similar topic in more lyrical, more affecting manner.
It is for most of its length a strong involving narrative with wonderful performances from the two leads, Heldenbergh and Baetens and a simply lovely one from young Nell Cattrysse.
Despite the miserable subject matter, writer-director Felix Van Groeningen manages to mostly strike the right chord, eschewing unchecked histrionics for honest, bittersweet emotion.
The juxtaposition of bluegrass music in this heavy-hitting drama about love and loss brings with it an unexpected and exquisite timbre. Take a tissue - this is an affecting film that touches the heart
A devastatingly sad movie that is beautifully constructed and performed.
"Broken Circle Breakdown" ends with a communal song in a confined space, not a dirge, but with hushed voices raised in envoi, and Groeningen's camera trickles down to pick out one last, final, lasting image. It all comes full circle.
It's a powerful film that builds to intense, overwhelming emotions with a very human core.
Sensibly written and thoughtfully directed, intuitively acted, bitter-sweet like Belgian chocolate, and propelled by incredible bluegrass music.
Electric sexiness and very modern motifs overlie a wonderfully old-fashioned melodrama... a highly gratifying one, if you enjoy a good ol' weep.
Raises itself far above its Lifetime Movie of the Week premise.
Groovy German bluegrass, if you can believe it.
