Orser, to his credit, never resorts to psychobabble, cheap sentiment or emotional shortcuts.
Leland Orser makes a raw, soul-searching feature debut as writer, director and star in "Morning." He plays the devastated father opposite his real-life wife, Jeanne Tripplehorn.
One of the more harrowing explorations of grief ever brought to the screen. By the end of its 95 minutes, only a faint ray of light has penetrated the gloom.
Though mourning is a part of the human cycle, Morning is not an easy film to watch -- save for the great acting by the entire cast.
