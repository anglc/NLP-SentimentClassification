Solid but derivative space horror ...
An elegantly crafted adventure in classical science-fiction.
This is an intelligent and engaging sci-fi thriller that's well worth checking out. Also, did we mention the space zombies?
Manages to break free from its low-budget limitations but is hamstrung by its own love of the genre.
... fairly elemental sci-fier from UK that, during its creepier moments, will remind genre buffs of Hammer's top-drawer Quatermass series.
