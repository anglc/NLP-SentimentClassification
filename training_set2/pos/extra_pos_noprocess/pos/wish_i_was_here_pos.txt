It is sometimes maudlin, sometimes trivial and sometimes very moving, but never less than achingly sincere.
The fruits of writer-director Zach Braff's Kickstarter are here for the general public, and they're at once vibrantly weird, beautiful and thoughtful.
Braff plays Aidan with easygoing exasperation and Hudson is better than I've seen her since Almost Famous.
Wish I Was Here is a funny, touching movie that features one of Kate Hudson's best performances and a curmudgeonly good one from Mandy Patinkin.
"Wish I Was Here" is a welcome, if belated, second chapter in a filmmaker's career. I just hope we don't have to wait another 10 years to see what he thinks about life as a forty-something ...
Zach Braff's second effort is a tricky one to value.
Since the adorable, simple Garden State, Braff's ambitions as a filmmaker have grown. He's reaching for answers to really big questions, but they are, just slightly, beyond his grasp.
As Aidan, Graff combines depth of insight with an endearing naivety, and the rest of the cast could hardly be better.
Zach Braff's quality sequel to his quarter-life crisis gem Garden State.
The movie is life-like, which is one of the highest compliments.
It sounds awful, but it's actually quite likable in an indulgent indie-spirited way, skipping breezily through laughter and tears in largely inoffensive fashion.
The personal awakening story is enjoyable and self-deprecatingly honest ...
Underneath its mawkish layers -- and there's a few to unpack -- Wish I Was Here is an honest, funny, and touching attempt by Braff to tackle serious and relatable themes.
While it overreaches itself at times, it's a warm, engaging and winningly sincere comic drama.
There's a charm to this piece, though it's an underwhelming, self-indulgent sophomore endeavour for Zach Braff.
A mildly engaging watch even if you wish you probably weren't there.
It may be entertaining, but Wish I Was Here is far less profound than it thinks it is.
Lacking - perhaps deliberately - its predecessor's hipster edge, WIWH functions as a grown-up weepie, following Aidan on a journey of enlightenment.
