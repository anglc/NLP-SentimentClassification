An original premise and earnest tone go a long way.
It's a frothy satire about adolescent social manners, a bit like "Clueless" or a tongue-in-cheek take on the 1980s-'90s "Degrassi" television series.
Director Darren Stein clearly has some serious themes in mind, even as most of his characters exhibit all the brain cells of amoebae.
Offers an admirable message of tolerance for teen audiences - too bad it's been absurdly saddled with an R rating, even though there's far less innuendo than in "Easy A.''
Extremely edgy comedy sends up gay best friend stereotypes.
It's a light, fluffy concoction but one so playful and unpretentious that it's easy to like. This is the high school movie gay teens have been waiting for.
When you reach the end of this title you feel rather exhausted, so maybe an entire season would be pushing it just that little bit too far.
The result is mostly swishy, sweet fun, although admittedly it might have benefitted from a bit of tweaking to fluff up bigger, better, and bitchier one-liners.
