"Kiss of the Damned" is rather a hoot.
An ambitious, if deeply flawed, vampire love story ...
The confident, female-driven sensuality of "Kiss of the Damned" anchors this handsome nonsense.
Cassavetes can film an erotic encounter worthy of the 1970s and the golden age of sex scenes, and that is no small compliment these days.
What distinguishes Kiss Of The Damned is its look, which combines the garish gore and muted tones of '70s Euro-horror with the subtle glow of modern moviemaking; and its sound design, which frequently mixes in a hellish throb.
Writer-director Xan Cassavetes is trying to go beyond the usual boundaries of the vampire genre. She doesn't quite succeed, but at least she tries.
a significantly more mature - and sexy - take on vampire romance, approaching its subject with sophistication and sensuality even as it indulges in gore and terror that's as metaphorical as it is visceral.
Manages to add a new wrinkle to one of cinema's oldest and hoariest genres.
A rare treat, especially for those who like to see grindhouse-oriented subject matter done with intelligence and substance.
The pleasure of the film doesn't lie in the plot; it's all about the sultry, horror-tinged mood that Cassavetes manufactures.
More of a macabre snapshot than a cohesive picture, capturing a specific throb of sexuality that helps to ignore frustratingly slack storytelling.
