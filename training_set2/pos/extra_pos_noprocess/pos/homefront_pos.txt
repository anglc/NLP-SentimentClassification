The deeper we go into this story, the more ridiculous the coincidences and plot twists.
Homefront is as gleefully dumb and thoroughly entertaining.
When Jason Statham stops to pat a kitten after MacGyvering up the bad guy's meth-lab to explode when the lights are switched on, you will either groan or giggle... if you are inclined towards the latter you may find quite a bit of enjoyment in Homefront.
[Blu-ray Review] Dynamically directed, legitimately suspenseful as the climax plays out, and consistently captivating for all 102 minutes.
Predictable but well enough made to hold something for fans of The Stath.
Director Gary Fleder gets into the rubbishy mood with ease, and there's an appealing if undisciplined generosity about the inclusion of supporting players
There's something to be said for one of those entertainers that goes about its by-the-numbers business with craft and style.
Half-satisfying little piece of gristle.
This unlikely teaming of Jason Statham and James Franco proves to be a clever blend of action and acting.
Just what you expect in a Jason Statham movie - and that is action from beginning to end.
Homefront is a film that understands its audience with a precise, non-condescending clarity.
Credit must go to Fleder and Stallone for refusing to settle for a simple, binary, good against evil actioner; investing the material with something resembling human interest.
Jason Statham is at it again. He is proving to be this decades ultimate action star.
