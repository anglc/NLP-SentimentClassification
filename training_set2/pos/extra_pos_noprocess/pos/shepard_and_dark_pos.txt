There is just enough of Shepard's lyrical prose and Dark's depth and humor to whet the appetite. You walk out wanting to read at least a few of them beginning to end.
The stress of their reunion yields fascinating insights into Shepard's work.
Both good times and bad bubble back up to the surface, giving the film an unguarded honesty.
A disarming but low-impact documentary that amounts to an odd dual biopic, "Shepard & Dark" can feel a bit like intruding on a conversation between two old friends.
[The] aesthetic structure creates a haunting sense of the simultaneously wonderful and sad feelings both men have about lives and loves now gone, never to be recaptured.
There's much to savor in Wurmfeld's insightful and oft-melancholy film about two old friends who've maintained said friendship since 1963.
Instead, after all that effort being put into showing this relationship in its fullest terms, they allow the men to, true to their mythic southwestern surroundings, simply walk into the sunset...
Enlightening and philosophical.
Treva Wurmfeld's documentary addresses, and acutely analyzes, the way friendship can bend, and occasionally snap, over time.
Treva Wurmfeld has made a lovely and insightful film, not just about this friendship, but all friendships, and how having people in your life who know you so well can be a comfort and a curse.
