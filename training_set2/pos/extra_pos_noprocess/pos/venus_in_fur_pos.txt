Like "Carnage," "The Pianist," "Rosemary's Baby" and more, Roman Polanski's latest is a creepy exploration of claustrophobia and perversity that should not be missed.
"Venus in Fur" is a stellar achievement.
Wickedly smart and wickedly playful, Roman Polanski's adaptation of David Ives' Tony-nominated Venus in Fur works on so many levels, it's almost dizzying.
Never underestimate Roman Polanski.
The haunted-house lighting is a perfect match for the claustrophobic intimacy of this two-hander - and camouflage, perhaps, for the fact that "Venus in Fur" remains more play than film.
Whether you like it or not, Roman Polanski is a great artist, and even the minor films of his fugitive decades glimmer with the claustrophobia and sardonic bleakness of his greatest work.
It's an actor's pic, and they both come through with grand performances.
"Revels in deception."
Polanski seems to revel in defeating the limitations imposed by this stagey project, which may be among the most personal of his career -- a movie that laughs at pain and sex and the absurdity of life even as it acknowledges life's terror and wonder.
While the extraordinarily talented Polish-born director rarely falters in translating the source's theatrical strengths, his Venus in Fur feels oddly impersonal, lacking the trademark touch of Polanski perversity.
The shifting power dynamics -- between the characters and the roles they are playing -- are enthralling.
As the pair comport themselves between the play's text and their differing interpretation, Polanski ruthlessly makes unsentimental play of their fevered, increasingly furious attraction. Carnage ensues.
A grand seduction staged in an intimate space.
Roman Polanski proves his dexterity once again with this dark, mystifying, and anything but simple two-character, single-location film.
It's witty, perceptive, penetrating, beautifully made, ties in with other Polanski works and feels like one of the filmmaker's most personal films.
A mature film but not an elderly one
Every good movie offers its own pleasures. Roman Polanski's adaptation of David Ives' play offers us a unique set of them: the moments an actor transitions ... The script ... is good, but what you're really watching is the acting.
What plays out is roller-coaster ride of shifting identity and sexual brinkmanship...Mischievous and sadistic by turns, it becomes a deadly serious battle of the sexes.
Fun, sexy, playful, and edgy, it also features two wonderful performances from Emmanuelle Seigner and Mathieu Amalric.
"Venus in Fur" is about the mysterious games men and women play, and Seigner and Amalric are up to it.
Mathieu Amalric is perfect as the director's alter ego as a director, but Emmanuelle Seigner's Vanda is truly superb.
Venus In Fur is essentially a weightless skit, a parody of those hoary old archetypes of Man and Woman. But it's also a tribute to Seigner, who seizes the gift of a role that allows her to be sexy, funny and imposing.
"Venus in Fur," the disturbing and provocative Roman Polanski film of David Ives' Broadway play, portrays a power struggle between the object of obsession and the eye of the beholder.
