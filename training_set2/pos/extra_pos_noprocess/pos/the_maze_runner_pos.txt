Teenagers are getting it in the neck again, in the latest dystopian Young Adult literary sensation to get the Hollywood treatment.
It's all familiar territory, but it's realized with flair.
Having not read the book, I was hoping for a more satisfying payoff than the one I got. Then again, maybe the filmmakers are saving the answers for the sequel.
A well-executed thriller and is certainly the best YA adaptation since the last 'Hunger Games' film.
It's briskly-paced, well acted and action packed. And as this is mostly a boys-only affair, we don't get bogged down by a tiresome romance.
One of the best of the current spate of Young Adult novel-inspired dystopian teen dramas...
The Maze Runner generally has ambitious production values, is well edited and boasts a thumping score. Think of it as Lord Of the Flies meets Alien.
It does provide flawed-but-fun entertainment for a young male audience, a la some kind of Dude-vergent.
Generally redeemed by feature first-timer Wes Ball's forthright action sequences.
The dynamics of the group and the mystery of what is really going on are enough to sustain the momentum of The Maze Runner.
There's nothing particularly original or insightful to set this teen-dystopia thriller apart from the crowd, but strong characters will build some anticipation for the next instalment in the franchise.
The Hunger Games meets Lord of the Flies in this fast-paced and enjoyably moody teen thriller adapted from the bestselling novel by James Dashner.
It's Lord Of The Flies meets Lost, but in a good way.
It's a well-made adventure with great energy and considerable style, but it's essentially a maze without an exit.
