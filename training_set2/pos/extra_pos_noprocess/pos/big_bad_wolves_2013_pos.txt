A suspenseful, violent horror film that touches on the inner lives of sexual predators, the question of guilt and remorse in the human soul, and the practice of torture.
Unpredictable, with a twisted surprise around each corner, Big Bad Wolves is a clever and arresting shocker.
It is an intriguing film with much to admire, but it doesn't always earn its pitch-black attempts at humor.
While Big Bad Wolves delivers the Hostel-like torture jolts with ruthless precision, the movie is also a rudely funny satire of a macho, paranoid culture where the protection of children is used to justify any conduct.
As dark comedies go, this is about as dark as it gets. The acting and stunt work are very solid. I can't say I enjoyed this, but the film is thought-provoking, occasionally funny, and it does raise some interesting moral questions.
We've seen this film before - as recently as in last year's Prisoners - but Big Bad Wolves still manages to feel fresh.
Wolves should appeal to fans of filmmakers such as Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino.
One thing that's indisputable about Big Bad Wolves: It's a slick piece of genre craftsmanship, a stylish, drum-tight thriller that magnifies the ugly extremes of crime and retribution.
A semi-masterful suspense picture that blends the violent appetites of Chan-wook Park and Quentin Tarantino, pouring such delectable disease into a film that's hypnotic, even as it details unimaginable suffering.
...an engaging yet uneven little revenge thriller.
Papushado and his old film prof Keshales are a dynamic duo, their second feature combining natural storytelling instincts, wry humour and slow-burning, edge-of-your-seat excitement.
There is something deeply disturbing at the heart of Big Bad Wolves and I mean that in the best possible way.
Two talented genre filmmakers to keep an eye on, especially if they're able to break away from far too familiar genre territory and try something even more different with their third movie.
Quite a find for genre buffs -- a horror entry that's at once unnerving, sardonic and, in a sick way, almost playful ... Sholem Aleichem by way of Stephen King, anyone?
A darkly impish, whimsically offbeat thriller of layered originality and subjective bite.
A torture-porn comedy about a child murderer sounds like an appalling idea. But Big Bad Wolves is disturbing in a complex way.
