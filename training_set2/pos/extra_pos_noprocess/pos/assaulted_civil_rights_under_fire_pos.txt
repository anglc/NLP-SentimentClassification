A surprisingly thoughtful, well-researched attempt to give both sides of the argument respect while illuminating the long history of tensions surrounding gun ownership in America.
While the film leans more heavily toward pro-gun ownership, finessing that position with a nod toward left-leaning politics, its real purpose is to bring some historical perspective to the argument, to move the conversation beyond emotion-based rhetoric.
The almost-complete absence of dissenting voices will likely limit its audience to gun-toting members of the choir, though anyone with an interest in the subject would be well-served by hearing its arguments.
