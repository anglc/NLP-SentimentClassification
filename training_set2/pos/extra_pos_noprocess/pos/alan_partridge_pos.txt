"Alan Partridge" could have been an expansion of Coogan's original character concept into the international big time. Thankfully, it's not.
The movie clips along and pleases its fan base, and it'll amuse a lot of Partridge newbies as well.
Recommended without hesitation.
Coogan is an old hand at the comedy of fear, envy, and bruised egotism, and the movie is packed with clever gags.
The way Alan feels on the outside is the way a lot of people feel at their most vulnerable. And so we watch him and recognize him, and then cringe and wish him luck.
Steve Coogan, Colm Meaney and the rest of the cast are very good. The plot has enough interesting twists in it to keep the hostage situation from getting stale.
It's Coogan's brassy performance that makes this English comedy rock.
Coogan walks that delicate line between being a character you love and a character you love to hate.
Doesn't hit every target or land every joke, but Steve Coogan's enthusiasm for the roleand the project as a wholeproves infectious.
Makes the transition to the big screen in a form that anybody can enjoy, whether you're already a fan of the TV sketches or not.
There's no farce quite as farcical as a British farce.
Coogan is on fire in this movie. Consistently, brilliantly funny.
Effectively puts the screws to every dumb, egotistical interviewer from Piers Morgan to Geraldo Rivera.
Only idiocy could possibly ensue. Coogan knows the role inside out, and some of the biggest of the film's many big laughs come from his full-on physical habitation of the character.
The film gets [this character], and more importantly, so does Coogan, whose lived-in performance ensures that every tic registers in a tangible way...
Coogan's comic timing has never been better, and Meaney is perfectly cast as his friend/foil. The film hums along at a brisk pace, piling one witty absurdity on top of another.
[Coogan's] eponymous feature debut here is very British and very funny. But after making a crackling good impression, Alan Partridge overstays its welcome.
