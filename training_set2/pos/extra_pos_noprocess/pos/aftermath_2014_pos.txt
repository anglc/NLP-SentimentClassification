The shocks, and the repressed wickedness, as in all well-done horror films, build slowly, then reach a crescendo that is hard to bear and harder to shake off.
Essentially, we're watching dead people refuse to lie down, yet the acting isn't terrible, and Scott Winig's photography is satisfyingly bleak and grimy.
Though they won't win any prizes for originality, writer Christian McDonald and director Peter Engert have fashioned a fairly involving, slow boil of a thriller that's as eerie as it is grim.
No one will be anointing "Aftermath" a feel-good triumph anytime soon, but there are flashes of unanticipated sensitivity and disquieting inspiration that cannot be denied.
Aftermath's strongest sequence is its opening, as the crisis unfolds and everybody speeds to shelter. The breakneck pace of this does a good job of building up adrenaline and crating a sense of high drama that lingers even when the story slows down.
Aftermath cleverly finds horror in the most obvious of places, hidden plainly on the faces of every American with an existing paranoia of nuclear warfare.
Engert's film comes into focus as less a story of survival than a bare-bones morality drama on the different ways in which the end might be faced... ending with images of such austere beauty and sadness as to have the raw impact of an epiphany.
A rumination on how long humans will actually last, if left entirely to their own devices. And it isn't pretty.
