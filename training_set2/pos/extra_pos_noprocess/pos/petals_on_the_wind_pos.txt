There's enough of the all-out V.C. Andrews flavor to make this installment worth a look for those who want to catch up with a family of soap people 30 years in the making.
Where Flowers was airless and po-faced, Petals is manic and sudsy, speeding through a treasure trove of sleazy plot twists like CliffsNotes on crack.
Soapy, sudsy, and scandalous, this take on the much-beloved (and much-reviled!) V.C. Andrews' book is a lot more fun than Lifetime's previous Flowers in the Attic.
