A modest but pleasant small-budget movie with two bits of laziness in the script, but one particularly sweet performance that makes up for them.
Weixler is a delight, and director Tom Gammill captures the right level of deadpan to pull this off.
A modest pleasure that greatly benefits from Weixler's charismatic presence.
