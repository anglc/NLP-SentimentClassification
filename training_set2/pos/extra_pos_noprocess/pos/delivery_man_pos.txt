"Starbuck" was a funny and warm-hearted trifle. So is "Delivery Man."
Delivery Man has a beginning, a middle and an end. And, for modern Hollywood, a pertinent everyman story to tell, too.
While those simple oversights may prevent the movie from achieving perfection, they rarely undermine its earnest endeavor to explore shifting family dynamics and their impact on our ability to connect with others.
It gets mawkish, quite severely so in places, but it's undemanding and feel good and sometimes funny.
Vaughn delivers an unusually heartfelt performance, verging on self-deprecation (as opposed to the usual smugness) and it gives us hope that he's finally growing up.
In remaking his 2011 French Canadian surprise hit Starbuck, filmmaker Ken Scott doesn't really try to do anything new.
Of course, it's schmaltzy and very contrived. But if you're in the right mood, you might also find it rather touching.
Objections are washed away by the ingratiating performance of Vince Vaughn.
