Some angst away from the dolphin tank feels like padding, but there's enough bona fide narrative to please tomorrow's marine biologists and their parents.
In a world full of cheapened, bombastic entertainment aimed at children, this modest, honest little movie feels special in its own way.
Children will revel in Dolphin Tale 2 with its rapturous, lovingly filmed sequences of dolphins playing, swimming, and generally frolicking about with each other and with their human friends.
It's wholesome, engaging and rife with impressive aquatic photography.
A beautifully shot, powerful, old-fashioned family flick told by smart and responsible adults.
You can have all of the big name stars in a film that you like. But when your co-stars are dolphins, not to mention an acting pelican and an impossibly cute sea turtle, you are always going to be playing second fiddle.
It doesn't have the focus or splash of the original, but Charles Martin Smith's sequel winningly wears its heart on its sleeve and Winter plays herself to a crowd-pleasing tee.
Perfectly harmless but also a bit pointless as it tries to manufacture a drama from true events that might have been better served by a documentary.
Smith keeps it swimming confidently along, propelled by decent acting, lovely cinematography and a great wave of wholesome charm.
In the end, it's the feel-good animal antics that will appeal and keep the audience on edge once peril rears its ugly head.
A little long and rambling but it'll cheer up anyone still recovering from The Cove.
Simple and slightly sentimental, it's a decent, feelgood affair but one with its heart in the right place.
As was the original, 'Dolphin Tale 2' is a prime example of excellent family filmmaking that is sentimental without being cloyingly sweet.
Director Smith, who also wrote the script, does a good job in moving the film along.
Dolphin Tale 2 lacks a bit of the dramatic heft of the first film, but that's a minor complaint given the satisfaction this sequel generates.
