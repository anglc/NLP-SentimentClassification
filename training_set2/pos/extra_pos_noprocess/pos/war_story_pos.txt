For much of the early going it's the burdened physicality that Keener brings to the role that tells us everything we need to know.
Jackson's spare, quietly powerful sophomore feature demonstrates an impressive control of mood and tone and the ability to tell a story largely without words.
In Keener's hands, the collapse feels urgent but not unhinged, and Lee's trajectory from steely and determined to openly distraught lends an otherwise meandering film a strong core.
So often does Catherine Keener play snappish or smart-mouthed characters that it's startling to see her behaving so tired and ragged throughout much of War Story.
Mark Jackson's War Story functions as a languid visual essay that passively contemplates Lee's warped psychological state, while avoiding any exposition of the events that triggered her present state of mind.
A dense and taut drama, a study on post-traumatic stress disorder that at its best is strikingly tense and heavy with sadness.
Jackson is wise to keep Keener's pushy, desperate Lee in centre focus.
