So much better than one would expect for a fifth installment in a franchise, this tribute to female friendship and girl power is a kick.
There are some gorgeous Disney touches, rabble-rousing songs on the pirate ship and the usual 'best friends for ever' message.
Ranks right up near the very best of the its franchise and thus the very best direct-to-video Disney movies ever.
Sweet and simplistic, it won't offer you the bells and whistles of Frozen.
It's an engaging and entertaining adventure story, refreshingly centered around a group of distinct female characters and even directed by a woman to boot.
At its core, underneath the swashbuckling adventure, Tinker Bell and the Pirate Fairy is a thoughtful tale of female friendship, of appreciating individuality, opening one's mind to new possibilities and always believing in second chances.
A lively swashbuckling affair that pits Tink and her Pixie Hollow friends against younger versions of the pirates from JM Barrie's beloved children's classic, which is a delightful notion in itself and gives the action an appealing dash and swagger.
Terrific stuff, beautifully animated and with a nice, positive message... it is great fun and another example of how new ideas can help keep a franchise fresh.
Amusing pirate-themed Tinker Bell adventure; some violence.
a fine film for children to enjoy with their parents
A congenial animated feature that grown-ups can enjoy, parents will appreciate for its valuable themes, and little ones will be over the moon about.
'The Pirate Fairy' is good enough to have opened in theaters instead of going direct to home video. It's wonderfully animated, packed with energy, and full of fun references to the 1953 film 'Peter Pan.'
Directed by Peggy Holmes it's short and sweet, will attach to parents' fondness for Peter Pan and keep younger kids happy.
Because Hiddleston is a genius and the scriptwriters obviously adore him, the ocean-bound scenes are less nightmarishly tedious than non-fans of the genre might expect.
The film is impressively animated 3-D fun, and while never ground-breaking and overly reliant on a saccharine-sweet sensibility, this edition in the series smartly racks up the action ...
