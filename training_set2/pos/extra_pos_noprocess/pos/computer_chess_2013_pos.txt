A supremely intelligent, beautifully constructed film, interweaving comedy and character, satire and subtext
A breakthrough -- not just for indie writer-director Andrew Bujalski, but for American movie comedy.
It's impossible not to see "Computer Chess" as both a humble, low-fi ode to evanescence and the deceptively cute baby picture of the digital disrupters who will soon bestride the Earth.
A shambling, Altmanesque ensemble comedy.
You need no particular knowledge or affection for the game of kings to appreciate the whimsy of "Computer Chess."
The movie seems like something retrieved from a thirty-five-year-old time capsule, which, in terms of the speed of technological change over that period, might have been light years away.
It's the type of film that introduces a type of funny that you didn't know existed, that isn't based in popular culture or punchlines or pratfalls or virtually anything that we've seen before.
Those weird elements don't take over the film, but they certainly make it a more delirious experience. It helps, though, that it's still grounded by real-feeling characters and an offbeat, low-key sense of humor.
Might bore viewers like myself who are not chess or techie knowledgeable.
Strange, hilarious and curiously moving.
As much as it is comedy, Computer Chess is also a treatise on isolation, social hierarchy and the crippling male fear of inadequacy
Think vintage found footage meets wilfully anachronistic dot matrix art. And then think way, way outside the box.
Odd, but in a good(ish) way.
The code for the future has already been written - and as Bujalski seeks to discover who we are and where we come from (not just as wired-in 21st-century users but as human beings), it's checkmate in 12 hilariously unorthodox moves.
Computer Chess will fill you full of nostalgia for the analogue era, which is quite a feat in this pristine, HD-obsessed world.
Like early Cronenberg, but funnier and sweeter, Computer Chess brings a dysfunctional, pioneering community to life. Bujalski must do a sequel.
A fascinating, genuinely strange and experimental film.
Director Andrew Bujalski's archly low-tech and improvised comedies can have a richly chortling edge and a nicely crude virtuosity and collegiate intelligence and warmth.
Its hilarious yet sombre approach harks back to the world of Hal Hartley, whilst creating a wholly original and at times perplexing incarnation of American indie cinema.
This is a philosophical comedy as dense and complex as any programming algorithm.
The spirit of Altman returns! A film to study, pick apart, discuss and debate.
A winning mix of deadpan comedy, retro stylings and escalating insanity.
Sourcing archival, analogue vacuum tube-based video cameras, Bujalski and cinematographer Matthias Grunsky deliver a work that really looks and sounds as if it belongs to another time.
It's fashionable to dismiss mumblecore as prone to obtuseness, but Bujalski offers a wryly funny slice of nerd-vana.
