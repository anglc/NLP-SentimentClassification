As in most documentaries, spliced-in reenactments are unhelpful. Still, what this movie shares is of great consequence, a moving and unlikely story in a tapestry of stories about a tragic and unlikely event.
A complex story is compellingly told in this powerful 9/11 documentary.
Danielle Gardner's eloquent insider documentary about the Sept. 11 destruction and subsequent rebirth of the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald.
[Gardner] interweaves stirring, ever-troubling9/11-related archival news footage, with personal photos and videos plus some, frankly, dispensable re-enactments.
Like every individual's story of Sept. 11, this one has hidden drama, heartbreak and renewal, adding yet another thread to the tapestry.
Closure or exploitation, you be the judge.
By de-emphasizing politics in favor of humanitarianism, Danielle Gardner's work also suggests how Americans might yet unify even as the world around them threatens to tear itself apart.
Compelling - it's an insider's poignant view of the harrowing tragedy.
...a Tolstoyan reminder that all tragedies are unique.
