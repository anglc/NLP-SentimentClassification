You may protest that this is just a splattery feature-length sketch, and you'd be absolutely right. Why not have a laugh at this absurdly trite concept?
As subtle as its title, "Cockneys vs. Zombies" is mildly funny and easily likable.
[Hoene] set out to make a funny, fast-moving gross-out zombie flick, nothing beyond that, and he has succeeded with style.
Maybe it's me, but after all the bloated, clanging, FX-driven summer tent poles, I'm partial to a gentle genre horror comedy that has gooey guts - but doesn't throw the heart out with the steaming entrails.
[Blu-ray Review] Director Matthias Hoene gives the derivative tale a refreshing wit to go along with the flit pacing and imaginative gore.
A satisfying, enormously likable genre cocktail, Cockneys vs. Zombies not only delivers upon its title promise, but does so with wit and fleet-of-foot aplomb.
Cockneys vs. Zombies quickly overcomes its dull-as-death titling and turns out to be the best zombie yuk-fest since Edgar Wright broke new, unhallowed ground with Shaun of the Dead nearly a decade ago.
A great and hilarious zombie picture with plenty of in-jokes about zombie lore and the London culture.
A horror-comedy hoot a la "Shaun of the Dead" but I actually enjoyed this one a little more. Matthias Hoene directs the knowing, very funny script with aplomb.
An entertaining romp with nitwits and monsters, keeping to the essentials of makeshift warfare while preserving all the necessary funny business. All that's missing from the effort is a translator for American audiences.
Matthias Hoene allows the cockney swears to flow as deliriously as the truly convincing blood splatter, offering a few unexpected gut-busters along the way.
All that Hoene must do is stage his action well (he does), nail the comedic beats (gets it mostly right) and generally bring enough freshness to the endeavour so that detractors don't bleat "It's not as good as Shaun of the Dead" (which it is).
I can't exactly call Cockneys vs Zombies an instant cult classic, but I'll absolutely call it a cult hit without hesitation.
