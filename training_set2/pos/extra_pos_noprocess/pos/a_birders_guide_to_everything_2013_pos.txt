The trek through the serene, beautiful woods highlights the banter between the quartet as truths are unveiled and friendships strengthened. The young actors shine revealing lights on their characters.
David and his friends are well-drawn portraits of innocents at an excruciatingly awkward age.
What's there hits the mark, so much so that I'll confess this one left me misty-eyed.
Though it's hardly an odd duck, "A Birder's Guide to Everything" has its own sweet call.
You don't have to be a birder to enjoy it. The movie shows that seeking the rare and elusive is often more than just a physical quest; it also is a spiritual journey that changes the seeker.
Instead of pandering to one and only one sentiment, this engaging offering -- poised pleasantly between quaint and quirky -- does entirely right by adolescent feeling.
The lead teens in particular give the material a realness that may not have been there on the page, and the filmmakers know enough not push the quaint story beyond the safe parameters it operates in.
This familiar-feeling coming-of-age tale benefits from an authentic script and believable performances.
That tidy resolution is telegraphed from the outset, but the energetic, never-mocking tone of all involved allows the film to stake its place alongside some of the genre's stronger and more enduring touchstones.
That very rare thing, a movie about teenagers where the characters actually seem like real teenagers, as opposed to mini posing adults.
The people who made this film brought the same loving attention to the characters that the characters do to the small feathered creatures they care for so deeply.
A sweet, gentle, and humorous movie with winning performances across the board. It leaves you with a warm feeling inside.
Nicely acted and emotionally genuine, the picture doesn't necessarily demand attention, but it earns appreciation through its delicate, nicely observed handling of sensitive issues.
A delightful coming-of-age tale...sweet and funny, with plenty of heart and intelligence.
A Birder's Guide to Everything should be standard issue for anyone looking to relearn the importance of a flock.
[The film] treads in some traditional teen-movie territory[...] But it also subtly conveys the stillness and sense of purpose that comes from scanning the skies [...]
