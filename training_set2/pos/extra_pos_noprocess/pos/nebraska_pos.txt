[Payne has] made an "American Gothic" for 21st-century, post-recession America. Who needs a pitchfork anyway, when you can have an ice cold bottle of Bud?
The deft achievement of this movie is that it has a hardness that doesn't delight in the meanness of mockery as the Coens often do.
An intimate road movie about one family that also lingers on the landscapes and fabric of an old-time, dying vision of the American Midwest
"Nebraska," it turns out, isn't as bleak as it first looks.
A desolate comedy-drama about fathers, sons, life's highways and missed off-ramps.
"Nebraska" is a wonderful comedy shot in black-and-white and told in shades of gray.
There are insights into old age, pearls of wisdom and gags galore, all wrapped up in a coating that's more akin to a bitter lemon than sugar.
It's a surprising performance from Forte, tasked with much of the heavy lifting opposite a tight-lipped Dern.
"Nebraska" is Alexander Payne's best film, bar none.
This may very well be one of the most powerful movies ever made about the misfortune of growing old and fragile.
A nice mix of arthouse quirk and genuine heart.
The sky extends forever across the flat land, never suggesting expanse, but lowering, confinement, pushing small, human figures to the ground.
A surprisingly talented Will Forte plays the son of a cantankerous old drunk, the fascinating Bruce Dern, as he takes a road trip to claim a million-dollar sweepstakes prize that no one thinks he's won. This is Alexander Payne at the top of his game.
Accompanied by a sleepy music score from composer Mark Orton, Nebraska is another wonderful feature film from director Alexander Payne.
Nebraska is undeniable; agonisingly hilarious, unyielding in its paternal love and devastatingly authentic to the ache of life closer to its end than the beginning.
There's a joyful tension that infuses every moment and makes this one of the most compelling, memorable, essential films of the year.
If you see only one black and white film disguised as a road movie this year or next, make it Nebraska.
Payne's most accomplished and emotionally affecting movie since his masterwork, About Schmidt (2002)
Veteran character actor Bruce Dern gets his day in court as the grizzled centrepiece of director Alexander Payne's artfully composed, beautifully filmed black-and-white dramedy about an old man, his dream and his withering, yet defiant sense of self.
Swiftly and smartly, Nebraska becomes an ode to small hopes, big leaps, and the texture of life in all its uncertainty and melancholy.
It's exemplary business as usual for Nebraska, a beautiful, bittersweet comedy-drama.
No film aficionado should miss 'Nebraska.'
There is a sentimental aspect to the concluding stages of the film: it's not as broad or astringent as Payne can be. But there's also something intriguingly dreamlike about its tone.
Alexander Payne is back in prime, prickly form with Nebraska, a marked improvement over his soggy, false-feeling melodrama The Descendants.
