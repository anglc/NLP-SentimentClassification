Really a well-made dispatch from a long war.
Thurman presents a largely even-handed recounting, wisely letting folks - and events - speak for themselves.
Of all the scary movies you may see this month, none will be more chilling than Scott Thurman's documentary about the Texas State Board of Education.
An alarming, hilarious documentary ...
Offers a balanced view of the fight over science and U.S. history standards for Texas schools, but lacks the punch it might have achieved with a stronger point of view.
Scott Thurman's new film The Revisionaries is a postcard from the frontline of America's culture wars.
Due to redistricting, every position on the Texas State Board of Education is up for election on the November 2012 ballot. See The Revisionaries and become better informed about the subject, and then remember to cast your vote.
Scott Thurman captures not only the fear and anti-intellectual resentment and insecurity that govern the dictations of the far right, but also the rampant unchecked egotism.
At once an unsettling documentary and an enlightening one.
This doc's look at the avid Texas State Board of Education (led by a smalltown dentist), invested in rewriting school textbooks in order to push ultra-right wing agendas, is a disturbing must-see.
