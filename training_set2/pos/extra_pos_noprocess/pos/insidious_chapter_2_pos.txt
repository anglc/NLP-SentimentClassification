Most of [Wan's] peers shoot a bunch of scenes and let the editor make a smoothie. Wan no longer relies on visual gibberish. He has become a classicist in that sense.
It's not gory, but relies on ceaseless weirdness with scores of jump scares and even an odd Back To The Future 2-style subplot that's undeveloped yet still adds to the overall sense of crazy. Love or hate it, this is pretty effective modern scare cinema.
It's a treat to see old-school film technique and makeup design rather than an overabundance of CGI work.
Carrying on where the last one left off, horror maestro du jour James Wan (Saw, Dead Silence, The Conjuring) serves up a juicy, fright-filled spookfest with this follow-up to the 2011 hit.
INSIDIOUS: Chapter Two has a good cache of scares; a necessary injection of mystery and despite small doses of clunky performances and scripting it's a rare, high quality horror sequel.
Trashy and silly and occasionally unintentionally funny, it is nonetheless weirdly compelling.
...often fares even better than its entertaining predecessor...
Amps up the scares without breaking any new ground while offering more layers and less gore than most films in this genre.
Wan and Whannell return to their 2011 hit with a vengeance, gleefully filling in the story before, after and even during that first chapter with even more gonzo nuttiness.
