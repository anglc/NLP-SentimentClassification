As contrived and endearing as the Christmas songs it celebrates ...
A rambling tour of Yuletide frivolity that comes from a very serious - and personal - place for the writer-director.
A gonzo mix of interviews and music concocted by first-time feature film director Mitchell Kezin. His passion for alternative holiday music is clear from start to finish.
The Christmas-morning thrill of discovery is appropriately evoked in this warm and spirited if scattershot documentary...
The best-selling singles in America have been Christmas songs and Kezin's look at the b-side -- the business of Xmas -- is entertaining.
