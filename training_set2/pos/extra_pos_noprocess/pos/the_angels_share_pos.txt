Modest in scale, expansive in emotions, this movie is a rarity: a contemporary tragicomedy.
Loach takes us through the mysteries of whisky making, exploring the subtle tastes and scents in ways that will have audiences wishing they had a dram at hand. But a glass also serves more symbolic purposes ...
If you want to look for it, you'll find a layer of metaphor (the distilling process as a symbol of the characters' evolution) and social-realist commentary amid the gentle, life-affirming laughs.
[Ken Loach] and his longtime screenwriter, Paul Laverty, find a good balance between drama and wacky character moments.
The film is cocktail of comedy and heist with a large shot of social realism.
