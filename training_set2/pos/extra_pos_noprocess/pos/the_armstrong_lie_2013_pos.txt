What will take your breath away is how viciously Armstrong crushed and humiliated anyone who dared to make allegations against him,
While the movie includes enough details about the physiology, strategy and marketing of bike racing to satisfy some of our curiosity, other questions remain unanswered.
The tale has plenty of resonance off the race course. As sportswriter Dan Coyle says in the film, "It's not a story about doping, it's a story about power."
The Armstrong Lie is eye-opening and myth-shattering and more than a little depressing.
Gibney gives the truth as full an airing as seems humanly possible, given that the subject is a world-class liar.
The Armstrong Lie has several insightful moments but is most interesting in how it shows us a filmmaker usually committed to finding the absolute truth in his subjects, suffering when he comes across a story where lies and truth constantly intertwine.
( ... ) a riveting, insider's view of the unravelling of one of the most extraordinary stories in the history of sports. Alex Gibney's two-hour movie races by in what feels like minutes.
The Armstrong Lie is a very good sports documentary, but doesn't reach far enough to become one of the best nonfiction films of the year.
[A]nother brilliant documentary from the ever-incisive Alex Gibney... not about cycling but the power of celebrity...
The lie is the least of it in Gibney's personal documentary
INCISIVE as it is infuriating, The Armstrong Lie chronicles the greatest fraud ever perpetuated in the history of organised sport.
It's an open wound of a documentary, sure, yet there is a pervasive sense Armstrong is using it as another means to redeem his public reputation...You might well find yourself sympathising with him more than reason would otherwise allow.
The Armstrong Lie gives great insight into a champion sportsman whose position at the top of his game meant he thought he could get away with anything.
It's a meticulous examination of a particularly ruthless brand of power game-playing.
Gibney's gripping documentary is a breathtaking expose, not only of cyclist Lance Armstrong as a drug cheat, but one that explores deep into the culture of the sport of cycling and its intrinsic doping problems
The Armstrong Lie presents an interesting perspective on him, and on his role in the science of doping.
The Armstrong Lie is a fascinating portrait of a man in denial, told from the firsthand perspective of Gibney, who himself was duped at a certain level by Armstrong's own confidence and charm.
We see an athlete for whom winning came before any sense of sportsmanship, catalysed by a cognitive dissonance that saw him come to believe his own lies.
As for the historical record of [Armstrong's] legacy, Gibney's doc makes a good first draft.
Armstrong comes across as both admirably resilient and frighteningly selfish, his treatment of those who crossed him (teammates with whom he doped, for example) tellingly callous, his refusal to be beaten bizarrely engaging.
Power must never be mistaken for virtue, warns Gibney, and self-regulation doesn't work. Even the best of us need to be kept an eye on.
This biographical documentary about disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong feels eerily gentle compared to filmmaker Alex Gibney's recent films, the WikiLeaks doc We Steal Secrets and the Catholic priest expose Mea Maxima Culpa.
Forensic detail is, one supposes, a little less easy to flog than damp-eyed talking heads. But one can't help but feel this film leaves an even more interesting story untold.
