It tries to be all genre and no story, and it almost works.
[Altman] attempts the impossible and pulls it off.
The Long Goodbye as a whole peels back the surfaces of private-eye stories, paying special attention to their macho bluster and abused women.
A playful de-romanticizing of the detective genre...
Robert Altman orchestrates a jangly genre autopsy, mischievous and brutal
A reminder that meaning, if it is to be found at all, is not always revealed through a linear assessment of hints and clues, but simply stumbled upon.
The look, the unconventional cast and the unconventional story make this a unique film, one of Altman's best.
Robert Altman's labyrinthine take on the Raymond Chandler classic is noir unburdened by a straight narrative - it's a triumph of atmosphere and attitude, a swiftly unfolding whodunit punctuated by subversive absurdities and shattering acts of violence.
Everywhere you look, there's something delightfully weird going on ... Altman and company fashion a state of slouching, freeform Zen that no one else has ever really duplicated.
When he was very near the top of his early peak, [Robert] Altman did the darnedest thing and made a private-eye movie -- or maybe a parody of a private-eye movie; it's hard to say. And he may never have topped it.
Simultaneously an act of revisionism as well as a parody of then-revitalizing neo-noir.
The reluctant and satirical mystery is one of the great Los Angeles movies and makes a great compliment to, say, The Big Lebowski.
Droll, cunning and magnificently woozy.
More a film about friendship and betrayal than murder.
[A] great classic.
Fairly good hard boiled detective story
It ends up with mixed results -- Marlowe is drawn as a goofy daydreamer (Altman calls him Rip Van Marlowe) and his story only gets interesting when Sterling Hayden, channeling Hemingway, goes bananas.
One of the greatest detective films of all time.
It may not be exactly like the novel but then this Philip Marlowe is nothing like anything ever seen before.
