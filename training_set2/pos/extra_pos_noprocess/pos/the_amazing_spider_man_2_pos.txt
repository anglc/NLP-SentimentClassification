There's a purely visual element to the storytelling that escapes many films of the genre - or, at least, everything but their action scenes.
This sequel masks the tragically personal--loss, grief, guilt--beneath sparking screwball romance. Swings a fine line between comic-book lightness and ever-approaching tragedy ... when time runs out, even for the most wise-cracking young hero.
If the previous installment was a bit darker and more somber, this one retains some of that edge but then injects a massive dose of pure comic book joy. This is what a Spider-Man movie would look like if Marvel Studios made it...
The film is a narrative disaster, but the character work is mostly solid and the terrific action scenes are worth the price of admission.
Passes comic-book muster
In spite of the numbing effect of this chaotic claptrap, the movie is still blessed with an incredible super power: the chemistry between leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone
