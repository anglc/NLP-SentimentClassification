This is what you get, San Francisco, with all your douchey, flashy, dot-com money: You get stomped on by Godzilla.
We're here to see the film's leading lizard, who is pretty gorgeously realized by an army of digitizers, even if he seems just a bit-player in his own movie for the first hour or so.
The first truly joyous popcorn action movie of the season.
The grandest illusion of the year. There's something gleefully mad about reintroducing Godzilla in a big spectacle, but keeping her on the sidelines while other monsters wreak havoc.
It might just drop your jaw once or twice, but to really establish the giant lizard as the star of a new franchise, this needed to be a more memorable outing.
Gareth Edwards' take on the king of the monsters is often entertaining, mature, and bold.
This new Godzilla [...] walks a fine line, and that it never loses balance is something of a miracle.
A foreboding aura manifests itself, and what Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey do throughout all of the giant monster scenes is keep them in perspective, framing every shot of the monster with scale in mind.
Rekindles a love for the great summer blockbuster and the monsters of our treasured nightmares.
What is the line? 'It's not the Godzilla film you want, but it's the Godzilla film you need?' But it's neither.
[T]here's a sometimes doggedly to-the-point quality to the film that you can't help admiring in contrast to the breathlessness of so much CGI cinema.
Exhibiting such creative styles of directing, Edwards hones in on all of Godzilla's personality traits that have made him such an icon to the cinematic universe.
... 60 years after he first appeared onscreen, Hollywood finally has done "Godzilla" right.
More disaster movie than monster movie, "Godzilla" is a thrilling film with a faint examination of imperialistic hubris.
An air of unfamiliarity, strangeness, and gloom hangs over this sci-fi blockbuster.
It cracks me up to hear people complaining about the dramatic depth of the human characters. THIS IS A GODZILLA MOVIE...AND IT RULES!!!
I swear that same sense of dread that overwhelmed me watching all those cheesy if menacing "monster movies" of the '50s and '60s came back once more, only now accompanied by a recognizable cast and superior special effects.
A proper-sized blockbuster, where the humans are wholly incidental.
