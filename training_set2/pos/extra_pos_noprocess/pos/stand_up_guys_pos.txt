Some actors don't need top-shelf material. Just the pleasure of their company is enough. And so Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin turn the insubstantial Stand Up Guys into solid entertainment.
It's just fun to watch Pacino, Walken and Arkin work together, very much enjoying the shared experience. Seeing Stand Up Guys is an offer you could easily refuse, but hey, why fight it?
If you don't think Al Pacino still has it in him, this is a welcome chance to be proved wrong.
A messy script isn't enough to undermine these clever veteran actors, who manage to make the most of the humour, drama and action without ever losing their dignity.
There's sharp dialogue and the odd, startling moment of emotional intimacy scattered amidst the dreck; enough to make this a solidly entertaining couple of hours if you try resolutely not to think about it too hard.
Frankly, if you put Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin in your movie, you don't really need to worry about the script: we'd happily watch them do just about anything on-screen.
With a little bit of chutzpah and a fistful of Viagra, the tough guys of yesteryear can still come staggering back to make a decent movie.
A rewarding mash-up of Last of the Summer Wine and Goodfellas.
There's much entertainment ... in watching a trio of great actors in the twilight of their careers, at work with a strong script.
Stand Up Guys is very much an old man's film, but Stevens just about delivers the performances that its ageing audience demands.
It's hardly great, but it's refreshingly old school.
There's something about Stand Up Guys that's both brilliant and poignant.
