Decoding Annie Parker is a movie about resilience, about staring doom straight in the face - with a smile, with hope.
This modest indie with major ambitions is directed by veteran cinematographer Steven Bernstein, making a solid feature debut.
Tears are shed in "Decoding Annie Parker," but they aren't accompanied by the kind of sad, misty soundtrack music that can leave you feeling used and abused. Instead of jerking tears, the movie edifies.
"Decoding Annie Parker," though uneven in its execution, has at its heart two remarkable women and one remarkable performance.
The film features a wonderfully nuanced performance from Samantha Morton as Annie.
There's a passion to tell this story with an understated urgency and profound empathy that can be felt in every frame of this terrific film.
Samantha Morton gives a fabulous performance.
I think it's an extremely worthy film... the performances are very good.
Powerful if a bit uneven docudrama about cancer, research.
An outstanding cast, a likeable narrator, and a thoughtful script take this out of the easy tears of the disease-of-the-week TV movie category.
This is a film that leaves you with a deep appreciation for the fighters of the world, as well as the individuals who tirelessly work to eradicate a disease we'd all like to see vanish forever.
