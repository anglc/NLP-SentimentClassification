Disney has another hit in its repertoire with this heartfelt story of sisterly love and one of the few films released in 3-D this year that splendidly incorporates the technology into the plot line.
Frozen reminds you how many animated films rely more on inside jokes. It's modern without being hip, earnest with being sappy.
Extravagant care is taken with minutiae, and the directors, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, whistle through the first twenty minutes of the plot with a controlled giddiness that would leave many live-action adventures staggering in their tracks.
If you thought there was only so much to be done with ice and snow as visual fields, think again along the lines of prismatic crystals, epic storms and fantastical structures built on water's gift for freezing itself into see-through art.
Frozen' has both showtunes and darkness, but most satisfying is a formula-defying finale that successfully subverts the fairytale status quo.
In a year of weak animated features, Frozen - loosely based on "The Snow Queen" - takes the lead by default.
The computer animation of the characters is expressive and detailed (we even notice the freckles on the shoulder of the heroine) while the film-makers work wonders with glacial landscapes in a land of "eternal winter."
Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen is the loose inspiration for Frozen, a celebration of family and the bond of sisterhood set against a beguiling snowbound backdrop. And like Tangled before it, Frozen has all the hallmarks of an instant classic.
Anyone with an appreciation for old-school musical numbers will find something pleasantly familiar and cozy about Frozen.
Frozen, the new animated film by Disney earns its charms the honest way: with smart writing and heartfelt performances.
It's a movie about fear and grief and the power of familial, sibling love to sort it all out. Weirdly, in movies that are almost always aimed at children, that's a love that rarely gets equal screen time in a romance-obsessed world.
The animation is simply superb. Ice has never looked so good, except as the real thing. Technical precision and innovation is expected nowadays in computer animation but Frozen combines that with a gorgeously rich design.
[Proves] that, when done well, there is still a place for big song-driven animation films in an age of quip-filled, pop-culture-referencing buddy movies.
As gorgeous-looking and highly amusing as the film is, it's the songs that deliver much of the emotional weight.
Amid exciting moments and gorgeous landscapes, Frozen is, at times, an uncertain whole. But hey, did you see that ice?
Top to bottom, Frozen is a delight. The writing is witty, the voicing is excellent, the story is nuanced and the songs are some of the best since Beauty and the Beast.
Frozen's narrative logic could be tighter. Some of its dialogue and lyrical content is out of step with some of the film's mature direction. But none of this is enough to cancel out what's rewarding about the story.
[Olaf] one of the most charming and hilarious Disney characters in quite some time.
An enjoyable fairy tale romp with some clever plot twists thrown in and positive messages for young girls that subvert those usually provided by traditional Disney princesses.
As tuneful as it is charming, Frozen is the best Disney animated creation since the studio was reborn via the musical vibes of The Little Mermaid.
There is a richness and a subtle sadness to the core relationship between Anna and Elsa.
Widescreen 3-D visuals sculpt an endlessly inventive setting of ice palaces and snowcapped peaks, the original songs... soar and tickle as needed, and snowman sidekick Olaf giddily beats back the encroaching melodrama.
Disney does two things pretty well: princesses and musicals. Frozen has both of these traits in force.
