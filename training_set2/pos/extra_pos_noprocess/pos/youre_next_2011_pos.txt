Given its title, you can be forgiven for assuming that Adam Wingard's home-invasion thriller will be just another blood-soaked body-count flick. But You're Next is better than that. A lot better.
By slasher standards, the writing is good, with interesting turns and surprises. And the acting isn't bad, either, though Vinson is the one to remember.
Home invasion thrillers seem to come along every five minutes... Kudos then to indie director Adam Wingard for kicking in with some fresh ideas.
Satisfies the expectations of Midnight Madness gore hounds - and then it happily goes about exceeding those expectations.
You're Next might be one of the most audience-gratifying horror films I've seen in quite a long time, rewarding the viewers as much as it likes to screw with them.
Not the perfect horror movie, but GORE-iffic nonetheless.
A sick, scary, and exciting amalgam of "Fortress," and "Straw Dogs," with a hint of Richard Connell's "The Most Dangerous Game."
Amidst all the slashing and killing, director Adam Wingard (working off a script by Simon Barrett) injects a good deal of dark fun into the proceedings, especially when it comes to unmasking the psychos terrorising the family.
If you're a fan of clever stalk 'n' slash horror movies, 'You're Next' should be your next choice. It's a fresh spin on the ever-popular 'home invasion' movies that have been around for years.
