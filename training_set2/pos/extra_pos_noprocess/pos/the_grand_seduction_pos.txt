Thanks to its cast, "The Grand Seduction" turns out to be, if not exactly groundbreaking, at least agreeable, comfortable fun.
So intricately plotted and unlikely that it verges on the exotic, "The Grand Seduction" is nevertheless a hoot.
This is all about duels between rugged veterans. Cheery Gleeson and craggy Gordon Pinset steal the show.
Though ultimately a somewhat forgettable feature film, The Grand Seduction does have a lot of heart and a certain charm to it which makes for an easy, gratifying experience.
Brendan Gleeson brings bags of charm and feeling to his role as the local-schemer-in-chief and there's some poignancy in the community's desperation to find employment.
Despite some occasional wobbles, this is a charming small-town comedy in the Ealing tradition, while Douglas Koch's attractive cinematography is almost enough to make you consider relocating to Newfoundland. Almost.
"The Grand Seduction" reeks of a pleasantness that makes for a very soothing watch. The lack of character depth and the contrived plot won't be placing it near any top ten lists, but there are far worse ways to spend two hours in a theatre these days.
A snug film about community and the torture of men out of work. There's a warmth to it, a likeability that doesn't wear off. Gleeson's big grizzly bear persona is a big reason why.
Offers familiar pleasures of no little charm. Sometimes that's enough. When the star is Brendan Gleeson, it may be more than enough.
Warmhearted and, thanks to Gleeson, laugh-out-loud funny.
Charming comedy, filled with breezy Irish blarney.
The Grand Seduction has mawkish moments, and it's way long. But it's still a very sweet movie, skillfully made and charmingly told.
