As British comedy sometimes will, "A Long Way Down" has an occasional attack of the cutes, but the actors' commitment keeps the movie on the plus side.
Author Nick Hornby establishes a tone of sentimental black humor, and director Pascal Chaumeil orchestrates the encounter as the formation of rag-tag band where each player gets a stirring solo number.
I enjoyed it, and I find myself hanging onto it, but mostly because of the interesting combination of its cast members, and the way they communally grapple with hopelessness.
Overall, the film's flaws are outweighed by its charms. Though it's not as deeply satisfying as About A Boy or High Fidelity, A Long Way Down is undeniably bubbly, heartwarming and funny.
