LaBeouf, who throws himself whole-heartedly into every role regardless of its worth, is a fearless and fascinating actor, and his sincerity holds the entire sleazy mess together.
There's underworld intrigue, and Bucharest gets to show itself off nicely.
This is a weird and self-indulgent affair that is easy to mock but that, just occasionally, captures the romantic feel of the equally pretentious but magical Leos Carax films of the late 1980s.
Shia LaBeouf is well-cast in this freewheeling combination of comedy, romance and action. He plays a scruffy guy with no plans and nothing to lose, lost in a strange culture while falling in love with the wrong woman.
The culture clash between the average middle American and the rest of the world is used to entertaining effect in this kinetic crime thriller.
Embrace the film's brazen weirdness (and forgive its inconsistent tone) and you'll find an off-kilter romance in the vein of True Romance or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.
Offbeat, Bucharest-set, film-noir romance with music by Moby.
