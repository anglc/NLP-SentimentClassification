If Fey ends up making movies as good as this one over the next few years, television's loss will have been cinema's gain, for real.
A romantic dramedy about a passionate erudite oddball woman with her own life? Hooray!
An engaging cast holds our interest even when this rom-com meanders down unnecessary sideroads and dips into corny sentimentality.
We generally expect more wacky humour from Fey and Rudd than this comedy, which is packed with perhaps too-smart dialog and a lot of warm sentiment.
A perfectly serviceable, star-led romance, Admission is also proof that some actors are just fun to watch in anything (which here extends to the supporting cast as well as the leads).
