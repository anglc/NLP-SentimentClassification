What Picture Day lacks in tension it makes up for in the writer-director's astute understanding of character and acuteness of observation.
This unusual coming-of-age comedy boasts excellent character development and involving performances. It's a promising feature movie debut for filmmaker Kate Melville.
Maslany is fantastic as the main character, and there's just enough irony and complexity to make this slice-of-life film seem relevant.
Picture Day leaves a pleasant aftertaste, and I can't help but chalk most of that up to Maslany.
