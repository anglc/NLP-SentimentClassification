"Child of God" fascinates like a song sung just out of tune but rhythmically sturdy enough to keep you listening in the hopes it'll right itself.
Surprisingly pretty good.
... certainly not for all tastes, but as a raw and visceral portrait of sexual and social defiance, it conveys a powerful glimpse into backwoods desperation and survival instincts.
With Child of God, Franco has come up with something distinctive that both captures the atmosphere of McCarthy's neo-Gothic universe and suggests a consolidation on the director's As I Lay Dying.
An ambitious but uneven attempt to translate McCarthy's book to the screen.
If (and this is a big if) you can get past the breaking of taboos, Child of God is a deeply affecting look at loneliness, survival and the cracking of the line between civilization and savagery.
