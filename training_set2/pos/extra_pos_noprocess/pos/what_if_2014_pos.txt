The dialogue is believable and funny, even if strays a little too often into the grotesque eating and toilet habits of the late Elvis Presley.
For a kid who grew up in public and is worth an estimated 60 million, Daniel Radcliffe does a convincing job of playing a normal guy.
"What If" flies by on the instant and lasting chemistry between leads Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan.
What If is that rare romantic comedy that's able to fulfill both parts of the genre qualifications, while at the same time overcoming the limitations placed on it by the cumbersome and overused formula normally associated with it.
With his first romantic-comedy, Daniel Radcliffe proves adept at delivering snappy dialogue and generating strong chemistry with his costars, so it's frustrating that the film is never remotely believable.
As far as diversions go, you can do far worse than "What If," but this is a one night stand of movie, and not the long term keeper you'll want to call in a few days to make another date.
Up until its cop-out denouement, What If manages to feel fresh even in spite of its well-worn elements.
This is a classic romantic comedy. Classic, by which I mean, quick-witted, and heartfelt.
Its plotting is predictable but Kazan and Radcliffe make a thoroughly engaging double act.
Entertaining in an instantly forgettable sort of way.
'What If' is 'When Harry Met Sally...' for the current generation. I guess you could call it 'When Harry Potter Met Zoe Kazan....' Has anyone used that yet? No? Good, then I'm stealing it.
Scored to inevitable strummy folk-pop, the film keeps itself amusingly busy until Wall and Chan do what it is they are going to do.
We're used to rom-coms that show off hot bodies (see Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis in Friends With Benefits). With these two, it's their melancholy average-ness that make us go wow.
Smart, sweet, entirely predictable and completely engaging, What If is the kind of fairytale romantic comedy that sends you out with a big goofy smile on your face.
