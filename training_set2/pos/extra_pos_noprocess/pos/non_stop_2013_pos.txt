The filmmaking is playful without feeling jokey, the narrative stuffed with fun complications.
Neeson, who brings enormous conviction to these late-career action roles, moves his big body through confined spaces ... with so much power that you expect him to rip out the seats.
Anyone planning to see Non-Stop should probably just go see it. This is one of those near-perfect, peeled-onion, airplane-hijacking thrillers in which each removed layer brings you closer to a single, happy tear.
Why demand logic of an action movie released in February, when audiences just want a nice, bumpy ride?
It's all fairly entertaining and eminently disposable.
A dumb action thriller with brains. Its closest relative is Executive Decision (1996), Kurt Russell's pulsating hijack thriller which might well have given Osama Bin Laden a few ideas in the first place...
Non-Stop is the kind of film that Hitchcock might have made in his heyday, or at least one he would have enjoyed.
For a good 80 minutes, Non-Stop delivers exactly what the title promises - an escalating series of exciting set-pieces with a great, mysterious backbone. This is top grade Hollywood entertainment.
Non-Stop has thrills, the dread of falling out of the sky, with Neeson dishing out some fierce action; but at times this Cluedo on a plane it runs out of steam.
Non-Stop is an engaging mystery filled with thrills that's sure to keep you guessing with every twist and turn of the story.
Neeson is again solid as a man with faults he must overcome to save those around him.
For the viewer who has thus far found the "Liam Neeson is a broken old man who pummels bad guys" genre to be devoid of any real merit, Non-Stop provides no counter-argument.
He elevates the otherwise B-movie thriller Non-Stop into a tense enough action picture.
Neeson effectively redeems the potentially ludicrous murder mystery set aboard an airplane during a transatlantic flight with a compellingly gruff performance
Mostly there's Neeson doing what he does profitably, glaring and growling through tight spots made to seem less preposterous by his presence. Other action heroes are sprier, more handsome or ripped but these days nobody snaps a neck better.
Liam Neeson is at it again in yet another enjoyable, disposable French-produced action flick in which a hapless, dishevelled guy with big personal problems is forced by circumstance to jump, run, growl and shoot people - often all at the same time.
The film reaches stratospheric heights of preposterousness, but the mix of whodunit intrigue, ticking-bomb suspense and pockets of turbulent action is ridiculously enjoyable.
Die Hard on a plane, Neeson's follow-up collaboration with his Unknown director Jaume Collet-Serra stages thrilling action setpieces in close confines.
A high-flying whodunit that will keep you guessing until the very end.
