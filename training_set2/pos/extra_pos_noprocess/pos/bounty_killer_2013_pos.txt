Turning its low budget into a self-mocking plus, this umpteenth 'Mad Max'-style dystopian actioner delivers trashy fun for genre fans.
It's all utterly silly and derivative but also undeniably entertaining.
It isn't the worst thing to blow an hour and a half on a film where everyone - including supporting players Gary Busey, Beverly D'Angelo and Kristanna Loken - seems to be having a good time.
It's violent, silly, and disgracefully entertaining.
Mad Max and Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! are just a couple of the exploitation flicks that come to mind in this entertaining slice of low-budget mayhem.
Like a spoof mash-up of Mad Max and Machete, this nutty action movie throws us into a Wild West dystopia with enough wit and energy to overcome its clunky production values.
Borrowing heavily from Roger Corman and Mad Max, this self-aware action-com keeps tongue firmly in cheek as blood sprays all over the desert.
Bounty Killers is an addictive celebration of all that is bloody, violent and explosive.
Pair it with the likes of Machete or Hobo with a Shotgun, and you've got yourself a fantastic way to waste a Sunday afternoon.
Part Mad Max, part Death Race 2000, there's never a dull moment in Henry Saine's wildly over-the-top Bounty Killer.
Irreverent, campy and zany. A guilty pleasure.
Imagine if Elysium had a cooler older brother who dropped out of school and gets in trouble with the cops all the time, and you'll get the gist of director Henry Saine's Bounty Killer.
Imagine a cross between The Road Warrior and Death Race 2000 and you'll have an idea what this sometimes clever and always action-packed post-apocalyptic romp is up to.
An immense and utterly excellent action thriller...
