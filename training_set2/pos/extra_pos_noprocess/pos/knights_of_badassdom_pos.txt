"Knights of Badassdom" actually delivers everything the 2011 Danny McBride-James Franco comedy "Your Highness" purported to be but fell short on.
Frequently sloppy and pretty piecemeal, but also rather funny and oddly likable. Strange flick.

I've been given a palatable taste of Joe Lynch's Knights Of Badassdom, but I'm now ready for the main course - Lynch's fabled Director's Cut.
A spectacular horror comedy never afraid to dabble in the silly...
[E]ven while it's apparently not what its creators intended, Knights Of Badassdom is perfectly enjoyable in a low-key way, with sharp performances [...] and a nigh-endless string of cameos
