You can imagine ET phoning his legal team, but although this kids' sci-fi adventure is derivative, its characters are drawn with more care and insight than you'd expect.
Combining some classic plot movements and plenty of modern trappings (just, like, a lot of cell phones), Earth to Echo is a sweet family film that has something for everyone.
With authentic characters, dialogue and settings, Echo's filmmakers have successfully created a story younger kids and pre-teens growing up in a Millennial and post-Millennial culture can relate to.
It has a good young cast, some occasionally dazzling special effects and a message that even when growing friends grow move apart it's not the end of their own little world.
Earth to Echo won't wallop young viewers, but I wouldn't be surprised if kids who catch this at the right age are utterly captivated.
Worth seeing for those who haven't seen it all before.
If 'ET meets The Goonies' sounds good to you, you'll love it.
Aside from some heavy-handed philosophising about how distance doesn't dilute friendship, this is a superior junior sci-fi yarn.
A sentimental, lightweight yarn.
It is a smart, visually dynamic film, but audiences may miss Spielberg's wonderment.
The cast do a fine job carrying the movie on their young shoulders, and navigate the rather unnecessary soapy story strands - one character has some tedious abandonment issues - with aplomb.
Does for E.T. what Super 8 did for Close Encounters. As lovably '80s as Reece's Pieces and pop socks.
