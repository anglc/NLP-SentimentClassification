Terraferma offers a sun-splashed meditation on compassion, tradition, tolerance, and generational change.
For the most part the multi-faceted story works.
Crialese and co-screenwriter Vittorio Moroni portray a way of life on that island in complete uproar ..
Involving, thematically rich ... yet also quite timeless ...
Emanuele Crialese's film burns with a sense of this situation's inhumanity, and he gives a palpable sense of life in a place where the beauty attracts tourists, but the natives are barely getting by.
The visceral passion of these tales of poverty-stricken but tight communities, dreaming and striving for better futures for their children, gripped me.
Fails to be convincing when it resorts to a paternalistic lecture on the right way to behave in modern times.
The visuals are memorable, and so are the characters and their moral dilemmas.
Another fine piece of work from one of the world's major filmmaking talents.
looks great and the screenplay, by director Crialese and Vittorio Moroni, is a nicely layered work that composes its several stories like a symphony.
uses an astonishingly beautiful setting to explore just who has a right to it.
[a] story of stark choices and uncertain futures.
Also a poignant consideration of traditional ways and so-called "progress" touted to improve things, Terraferma is a nostalgic type of high-quality foreign drama that, in the old days, would have "stuck" on screens or become classic in some sense.
Ignore the bad reviews from my jaded colleagues. This is not only a compelling story that goes to the heart of the immigration debate, it is a lovely work of art in the grand Italian neorealist tradition.
