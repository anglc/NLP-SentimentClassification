As remorseless in style as it is in message, "In the Fog" offers little hope and few pleasures, but earns admiration for its elegant exploration of the lowest depths of the human condition.
Intimate in the telling, sweeping in the implications, Loznitsa has created an unusually incisive film.
In the Fog, which seems to me a masterpiece, is about occupation and the destruction of an understanding of one's own history.
Even when the pace wanes, the images are still gripping.
The world and its choices are often cruel, but for all the devastations visited on the characters, Mr. Loznitsa is searching for the human good amid a human catastrophe.
In the Fog has the inevitability of an avalanche, and only our overfamilarity with Nazi-tribulation scenarios, and perhaps its excessively punctuated ending, could slow it down.
Powerful existential drama about the tension between morality and the imperatives of warfare against the century's most immoral regime. A sign of the continuing health of Russian film after the devastating blow of Yeltsin's privatization.
Sergei Loznitsa occasionally writes his ideas too explicitly in the film's dialogue, though he makes up for this by deftly employing some ironic symbolism elsewhere.
Hollywood action movies build up to a frenzied crescendo. Here, it's exactly the opposite. But you'll still end up holding your breath. In the fog.
Like Come And See in neighbouring Belarus, it's a stark vision of humanity in a hellish world. Tough and thought-provoking.
Sergei Loznitsa's stark parable about Soviet collaboration with the Nazis has echoes of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky.
Nothing is clear in a film that is as challenging as it is rewarding.
[An] austere but never ponderous film about war, and its effect on those caught up in impossible circumstances ...
Though he is more often a documentary maker, In the Fog marks a profound shift for Loznitsa: there is nothing ad hoc or casual here.
In The Fog is one of the most impressive films of this year, a brutal tale told in the most languid language imaginable. Unmissable and a terrific step forward for Sergei Loznitsa.
In The Fog finds Loznitsa pinning down an assured narrative groove.
The performances possess a powerful authenticity, whilst the poignancy of the fog-bound finale lingers in the mind.
