Though viewers may already be aware of how DeChristopher's 2011 trial ended, the film maintains a gripping air of tension and mystery leading up to the verdict (he was sentenced to two years in federal prison for fraud but released after 21 months).
"Bidder 70," for all its clumsiness, nails the way that a spontaneous act of courage can focus the mind and clarify an ideology.
DeChristopher's ability to move with intellectual seriousness and a light heart between festivals and courtrooms complicates the popular idea of The Man and what his brand of power can achieve.
Gripping documentary about a young man who risked a stiff prison sentence for doing something to stop global warming, a crisis that could lead to the deaths of 100 million people.
Bidder 70 is modest but revitalizing.
A powerful, empathetic portrait of a selfless, planetary patriot willing to sacrifice his liberty for the sake of Mother Earth's long-term prospects.
Without being didactic, the documentary demonstrates how an ordinary concerned citizen can take a stand when politicians neglect to make decisions for the good of the people and instead serve the interests of big business.
