This Canadian feature cleverly mixes archetypes from war films and coming-of-age movies, defamiliarizing both genres in the process.
[A] surreal, strangely effective look at childhood imagination.
The performances may be slightly uneven across the cast of a dozen distinct personalities (plus a dog), but overall the effect works because, after all, they're just playacting ... right?
"I Declare War" captures the awkwardness of preadolescence as well as any film since "Stand By Me."
A unique and out of the box film, and though the end result is only above average, it's still worth watching.
A breath of fresh air, whether you're looking for a good movie about kids or a good war picture.
Both playful and nostalgic, it's the kind of movie that stands to be appreciated on some level by anyone who has ever pointed a stick and yelled, Powpowpow!
It's both a nostalgic ode to the creativity of youth and a tragedy of growing up, wrapped in the graying dynamics of war as playtime...
Its unpredictable tone clicks back and forth between the comical and the serious like the safety catch on a firearm. But no matter what you ultimately think about it, you can't deny one thing: It's not like anything you've seen before.
I Declare War works best not as a Lord of the Flies riff but as a solid look at how close middle-school emotions are to the surface and how imaginary wars become real-life conflicts in the space of a too-harsh word.
