A sometimes amusing sex farce ...
"Bad Johnson" works much better than it should. Because, really, it shouldn't work at all.
A nice romantic comedy disguised as a moronic raunch-fest.
Johnson has an adequate sense of humor, providing some hilarious punchlines here and there, but miscasting is the tight leash that keeps the film from truly inspired madness.
