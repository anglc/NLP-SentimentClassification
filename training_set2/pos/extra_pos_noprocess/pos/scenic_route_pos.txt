It's actually a well-made, well-acted low-budget thriller that is more resonant than expected.
At the very least shows you how to make a smart, cheap little movie with only two actors, one main exterior set and no special effects.
It begins with energy, dulls in the middle stretches but redeems itself with a final destination that makes the trip feel worth it.
Refreshingly intelligent and palpably suspenseful. Josh Duhamel and Dan Fogler give the best performance of their career.
Perhaps even more effectively than The World's End - but in a less escapist fashion - this is a parable of responsibilities and foibles filtered through genre (horror, in this case).
Lined with a certain bruised grace... a spare, streamlined, desert-set psychological thriller that doubles as a study in masculine relationship drift.
Scenic Route is an unsettling and wonderfully obtuse picture that will provide a different experience for every viewer.
Scenic Route is a movie that crawls under your skin and stays there for a while, thanks largely in part to its haunting ending.
Scenic Route offers strong roles for Josh Duhamel and Dan Fogler, and while familiar in tone and structure it is watchable and well performed.
When Scenic Route works it really works, and it's definitely a trip worth taking.
This script, by Kyle Killen, and direction from brothers Kevin and Michael Goetz have resulted in a very powerful film that you should see with your best friend. Then take a road trip together. You both might need it.
