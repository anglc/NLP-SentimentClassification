Malick is employing his usual style of montage and voice-over narration but in a new, contemporary setting that makes Wonder feel like his most vital work in years.
What is most affecting is Malick's intent. He plainly devised the story to give him a series of panels for the expression of feeling.
Jane and Neil find themselves brushing against each other in a large field right up next to a herd of brown bison amid rustling grasses, as if grass were ever still when a camera, Malick's camera, is directed its way.
Instead of searching through the mysteries of the universe, Terrence Malick cuts open his heart for all to look inside.
The bursts of beauty Malick creates have true redemptive power.
I think there's something sufficient to love about such a bold film.
To The Wonder - the best American feature by far of 2013: beautiful, compassionate, tragic, transcendent.
