Bizarre, hypnotic, audacious.
The emotional places this troubling movie takes him to are rewardingly primal and potent, forcing both subject and viewer to wrestle with internal demons.
I certainly do not move that the film should be suppressed, only that one should know what it is. It is a bath in a smiling madness.
This stunning "documentary of the imagination" shows Anwar and other thugs staging scenes of torture and murder for the camera.
In The Act of Killing, director Joshua Oppenheimer pulls off the impossible: He confronts great, incomprehensible evil and puts a human face on it.
Joshua Oppenheimer's documentary interviews leaders of Indonesian death squads responsible for deaths of millions & has them re-enact the killings. The combination of drama therapy and accidental self-exposure - utterly bizarre, unexpected and valuable.
Maddening, sorrowful, brilliant, and unforgettable.
The film of the year, if not the decade, if not documentary history.
Most challengingly, though, there is something palpably cathartic about the ritual of the re-creations.
One of the most audacious documentaries ever made, this mind-boggling film forces us to examine our opinions about human history far beyond the events covered on-screen.
Bizarre documentary featuring Hollywood-inspired, interpretive song and dance reenactments of ethnic cleansing in Indonesia.
Raw and wrenching but narrow retro-focus on the slaughter of millions of Indonesian leftists in collusion with the CIA. But much like Out Of The Furnace, locating truth evasively within the masses, rather than tracing US government and economic roots.
It's a long and uncomfortable journey, but The Act of Killing is also fascinating, using film as a hall of mirrors to reveal not just the faces, but the twisted souls, of murderers.
Oppenheimer demonstrates how easily the passive spectator can become an unlikely abettor, and the great cause of his film is to make his actors and audience recognize their moral culpability.
[The film explores] what happens when you give those who have done something terrible (in this case, killing thousands) a forum through which to tell their story to see if a new perspective changes their attitude.
The shock of the final scene must be left unspoken; suffice to say its impact exceeds even the nightmarish queasiness which this brilliant and horrible film has striven to contain.
I hate to make statements like this, but here it comes: The Act of Killing may be the strangest documentary you see this year (this decade?).
The cameras bring out the worst in all concerned, who think nothing of singing and dancing about mass murder.
This is living history as a surreal pageant.
One thing's for sure. You won't see another documentary like this one.
Of all the uncomfortable experiences you might endure in the name of understanding the evils of history, this film is arguably the kind that is most necessary.
The Act of Killing works brilliantly on many levels, capturing like no other documentary I have seen, like no other film I can imagine, the fevered insanity of those days.
The originality of The Act of Killing lies in Oppenheimer's decision to treat artifice as a roundabout path to truth.
