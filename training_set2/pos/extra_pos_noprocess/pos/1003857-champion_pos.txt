Kirk Douglas does a good, aggressive job, with a slight inclination to over-eagerness at times, which might amuse an old fight fan.
In his first Oscar nomination in Mark Robson's compelling melodrama, Kirk Douglas gives a ferociously realistic performance as a boxer determined to succeed at all costs.
One of the best fight films ever, also one of Kirk's best
Robson's direction is all action, wasting no time in telling this compelling story, and Carl Foreman's script is sharply observant of the boxing milieu.
Douglas is so perfect in the role that the movie is never less than gripping.
Brilliant, searing, heartbreaking.
The contrasting black and white cinematography perfectly fits the dark mood. The fight sequences are excitingly and realistically staged.
