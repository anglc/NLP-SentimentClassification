If you're in the mood for some slick trash featuring great actors slumming it without phoning it in, "Broken City" is a crackling good time.
The picture comes out swinging with both a conscience and a set of brass knuckles; it also features a Russell Crowe who doesn't, thankfully, sing. What's not to love?
Broken City is passable, occasionally entertaining but ultimately uninspiring.
It is predictable procedural fodder - you can see the "twists" coming a mile away - but done with enough conviction to paper over the plot holes and cliches.
It has ideas and, in places, verve, but it can't help but feel like a pretty standard thriller with some big names rather erroneously attached
