"Small Time" is agreeably sentimental meat-and-potatoes fare with strong dashes of humor, executed with a sincerity that's hard to resist.
Don't let the title of this indie gem fool you, "Small Time" has humor and heart big time.
Writer-director Joel Surnow, the co-creator of 24, makes an assured, tangy feature debut with this semi-autobiographical story.
Filled with humor and heart, it's an insightful, endearing father/son coming-of-age comedic drama, destined for well-deserved popularity on the DVD shelf.
...a decent yet unspectacular debut that could (and should) have been so much better...
Toss in some scenes cleverly reminiscent of the spritzy routines of Diner (but with older folks) and the boiler-room sales tactics of Glengarry Glen Ross, and you've got the best highlights of Small Time...
Powerful, wise and uplifting. It's a perfect Father's Day movie. One of the best family dramas in years.
Small Time gets great mileage from its central characters, who manage to do some pretty mean things without coming across as irredeemably bad people.
With his personal proximity to the subject, Joel Surnow brings genuine warmth to his characters. Some of the gags and drama feel artificial, but the movie works because the talented cast sell it so well.
'Small Time' still closes the deal, thanks to that one indefinable selling point: star charisma.
A refreshingly-realistic, slice-of-life drama highlighting the plight of a teen with a hole in his soul who's understandably torn between moving on with his life and making up for lost time.
