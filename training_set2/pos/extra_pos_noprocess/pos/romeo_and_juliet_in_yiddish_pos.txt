A charming and entertaining movie that instills a little fantasy into the mix.
The performances are uneven, but there's a grimy thrill to seeing scenes from the play in subway cars and on fire escapes.
The film, written and directed by Eve Annenberg (who also stars) is sprawling and sometimes confusing, but its premise is charming and not at all far-fetched.
There have been many untraditional film adaptations of Shakespeare's, but few have been as unorthodox as this one...
Annenberg's attitudinous Shakespeare riff is a unique blend of psychodrama, ethnographic experimentation, and high-concept hustle.
[B]lows away Shakespearean fairy dust on fusty nostalgic notions of classic Yiddish theater, with exuberance of lo-fi Luhrmann in a West Side Story set in exotic Brooklyn.
The writer-director has bitten off a bit more than she can chew but this is a must-see for anybody who loves the sound of Yiddish, as well as those interested in Jewish culture in general. The young actors, renegades from the Satmar, are superb.
If Shakespeare were alive today and in good health, as I'd wish him to be in, he'd probably be begging for a circumcision to honor this little film that gets the gist of his most famous tragedy down pretty well.
