Non-Bruce fans or casual fans may want to check this film out, but it's really for true believers. If it never explains why they're true believers, the real truth is that it doesn't matter.
There are, however, a couple of bits that seem to get to the heart of Springsteen's singular place in the pop music world.
Springsteen & I captures rock-star and rock-fan power and resolve at its funniest, grittiest and most profound.
The movie is essentially made by Springsteen fans, so naturally it's pretty much made for Springsteen fans. Haters need not apply.
You pity the kids of the more Boss-obsessed but there's pomposity-pricking humour and uplift here, too.
As much as it's a love letter to Springsteen (who provided footage but reportedly had no editorial control over the content), it's also a love letter from fans to fans.
It's a quirky little film, at turns charming and creepy but ultimately redeeming, about people who are extremely devoted to the 63-year-old rock star.
The fans are fun but the archival footage, including a large chunk of a live show that will play after the film to boost its meager running time, is the real draw.
Nice, if you like that sort of thing.
This isn't really a film, it's memorabilia.
One fan defines him as a Working Class Hero. But the words most fans, myself included, want to pass on to Springsteen come straight from the heart: Thank you!
As much as this is a film about extreme fandom and joys of getting close and personal with a music legend, Walsh's film also offers a neat examination into the art of stage banter.
An entertaining documentary about Bruce Springsteen, his loyal fans, and his impact on their lives.
Springsteen & I is an emotionally raw, intimate glimpse at hero worship and what it is to be a Bruce fan.
