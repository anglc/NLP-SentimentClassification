Writer-director Tom Gilroy has worked with Yelich previously and makes his youthful character the quiet, watchful center of this 2013 indie drama.
Gilroy takes all of this to a more realistic, more interesting place, and he manages to find an ending for the story that offers a touch of optimism but doesn't feel like a cheat.
Thoughtful and touching ...
Best when dramatizing how the land itself comes alive and serves as a character in its own right, resurrecting the buried history of the US Anti-Rent Resistance Movement of the 19th century. And perhaps a lesson well taught to an endangered rebel child.
As written and directed by Tom Gilroy, it consists entirely of discoveries.
A likeable drama about an eleven-year old who survives living on his own in the forest but finds it more difficult to get by when he returns to civilization.
The Cold Lands [...] sustains a lovely mood, but keeps the audience at a perpetual distance. It keeps threatening to turn into a movie, but never entirely does.
