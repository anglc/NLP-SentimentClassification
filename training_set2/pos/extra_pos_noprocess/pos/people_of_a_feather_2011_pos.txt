Interweaving Inuit life today with re-enactments of the culture 100 years ago, "People of a Feather" warmly portrays a cold, uncertain present and a worrying future.
People of a Feather is best as a nature documentary, assembled from stunning footage of these fascinating creatures flying about the islands and diving into the Bay looking for food.
An important documentary that will inspire you to help save Inuit communities and the sea ice ecosystems in Hudson Bay.
Visually stunning and featuring the always engaging Inuits, the film hones in on the threats to the animals they rely on for survival but all of humanity. No man is an island...
Another director might have focused narrowly on the hydroelectric industry, but...Heath takes a more measured approach. In the process, he portrays the people...with sensitivity and insight. Their lives are what give this documentary its real value.
If you're down with down and give a damn about dams, this is your movie.
