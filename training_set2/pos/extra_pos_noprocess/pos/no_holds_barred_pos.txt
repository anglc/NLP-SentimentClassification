The movie never takes itself seriously and director Tom Wright (TV's "Beauty and the Beast") has fun with the wrestling montages. Hogan himself has an appealing screen presence -- like a gallant teddy bear who goes berserk every 10 minutes or so.
Hogan as The Ripper is a force of nature here, and he makes "No Holds Barred" in to a fun action cartoon.
