Zach Donohue's debut feature ingeniously uses only computer images to tell its tale.
Scenes pulse with the Internet's speed and sprawl, aided by clever editing that pops.
The results are a paranoid thrill ride into twenty-first century manipulation and exploitation, a pseudo snuff film whose very making we witness, and whose impact comes from our awareness of its chilling plausibility.
taps into contemporary anxieties about both the very public nature - and anonymity - of the lives that we lead online, building towards a sadistic, cynical ending
Cowriter (with Lauren Thompson)/director Zachary Donohue puts a new spin on the 'found footage' genre with this incredibly clever and creepy film that delves into our worst online fears.
"The Den" is unsettling without being excessively gory, building legitimate dread rather than resorting to cheap scares.
Moves like a bullet and jolts the hell out of you on a regular basis. This is the kind of film that, when it's over, makes you want to sit down and calm your nerves for a while.
The Den still manages to make it feel refreshing within the glut of first-person fright flicks on the market.
The Den isn't up to the level of format/genre classics like the first two [rec] films, but it's easily one of the best FF-like movies to hit screens in the last five years.
The film is dizzyingly creepy in its refracting of horrors through the cascading windows of computer programs we've come to understand more intimately than our own selves.
The Den has some pretty compelling things to say about the alleged safety of the internet. Also it's creepy.
The Den is a pulse-pounding bit of techno horror that somehow makes the internet even more horrifying than it already is.
