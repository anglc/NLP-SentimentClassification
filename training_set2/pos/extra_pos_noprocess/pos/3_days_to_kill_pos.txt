Pure trash but it's entertaining as hell.
French filmmaker Luc Besson continues to combine family themes with intense violence (see Taken), but at least this film has a wry sense of humour about it.
n the end it's Costner who's the film's saving grace, his chemistry with Steinfeld lends the movie enough emotional weight to make it tolerable in between the car chases and gunfire.
The aim is a little off, but at least it's nice to see that Costner is still firing on all cylinders.
