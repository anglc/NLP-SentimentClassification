The first hour may be Bay's career high point: it's fast, freaky, gloriously tasteless and startlingly pointed in its attacks on western insecurity, shallowness and greed.
Now [Bay] hits new levels of both artistry and sleaziness in the black comedy Pain & Gain, which I strongly recommend if you don't overvalue taste, subtlety, and moral decency. I liked it.
An often hilarious black comedy with a nicely embedded moral.
While Pain & Gain often frustrates, Bay's overwhelming cinematic sense is undeniable.
Michael Bay has finally made a film worthy of deep consideration.
While not a faithful re-enactment of a horrific true story, Pain & Gain will certainly please those looking for cheap thrills
...the film occasionally approaches something resembling satire. Bay's attempts at humour are not always insightful though - a dead woman's breast implant still gets giggled.
Michael Bay's lurid crime comedy Pain & Gain is as excessively pumped-up as you would imagine, a berserk, overblown action movie on steroids.
Pain & Gain is Michael Bay's best film yet, fusing his high-octane and in-your-face directing style with pitch black comedy that makes for the funniest film of 2013.
This is Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson straining every sinew to deliver the heavy duty performance of his career.
Might this be the best Michael Bay film ever? We know what you're thinking. But we mean it in a good way.
The closest Michael Bay's natural style for flash really feels like an organic extension and expression of the material's narrative and characters rather than mere surface gloss.
The performances are first class and help make you warm to the lunkheaded trio against your better judgement.
The uneasy blend of comedy and ultra-violence will turn some viewers off but, if you can stomach it, you may find yourself curiously entertained.
