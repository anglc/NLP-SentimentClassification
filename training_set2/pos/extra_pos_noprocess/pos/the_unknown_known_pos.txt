Morris is admirably evenhanded, never demonizing his subject, but giving him enough rope to hang himself. Rumsfeld, cool and bemused, refuses to knot the noose.
[A] scary inquiry.
By now the director's technique is so savvy, so confident in its visual layering and atmospheric assurance, even a dodgy, cagey camera subject such as Rumsfeld becomes movieworthy.
Morris doesn't "break" Rumsfeld, as some think he did McNamara. He has held a mirror up to the man, and found no reflection. The viewer simply has to realize that what's important is what's not there.
What emerges is a fascinating portrait of a bygone approach to power, marked by a seemingly contradictory mix of transparency and obfuscation. Rumsfeld embodies that discrepancy.
A portrait of a wartime leader determined to avoid, at any cost, an honest perspective.
Delights in exploring sophistry and fine distinctions of language.
It's about how human beings make horrific mistakes sometimes without ever understanding why ... and without ever once thinking they did.
Part political portrait, part Iraq war post-mortem, part interrogation, it's a fascinating look at a man who -- like it or not -- will go down in history.
This documentary interview with Bush-era insider Donald Rumsfeld is like a horror movie with a calm sociopath at its center.
It is, by definition, nonfiction, but at times suggests a horror movie.
Part investigation, part inquisition and all around fascinating experiment into trying to dig underneath a deeply buried stone wall of charismatic defiance.
The Unknown Known doesn't paint Rumsfeld into the Shakespearean archetype that Morris intended; instead he toed the company line. This documentary has Rumsfeld winning on points.
Not even Errol Morris' infamous Interrotron - a camera-rig that gazes right into the subject's freaking soul - can pierce an unyielding Donald Rumsfeld in The Unknown Known.
Morris's commentary comes in the form of stunning images ... and a truly beautiful score ... The Unknown Known is revealing, but what it reveals is emptiness.
Donald Rumsfeld and Errol Morris live on opposite sides of the screen
Morris has questions, Rumsfeld has quibbles, and most of what he gets from the man are those infernal little grins that someone must have told him in his youth were very, very cute. He seems to think that he's impish, a mere scamp.
The picture amounts to one grand show of self-incrimination.
I hoped the film was a front for a citizen's arrest: Donald Rumsfeld shipped off to the Hague. Still, the movie is as insanely entertaining as a Mad Hatter's tea party.
