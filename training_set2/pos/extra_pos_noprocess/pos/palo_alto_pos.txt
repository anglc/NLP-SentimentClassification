Ultimately, "Palo Alto" is a messy yet haunting portrait of a particular time in life.
It's accurate to say that "Palo Alto" is another movie by another Coppola about the lives of the rich, bored and disaffected, but that description sells the movie short.
That Coppola finds occasional grace and spirit here shows understanding and compassion. Her next assignment? Make a movie that's not about the troubles of the privileged and bored.
These slippery slices of life feel like the most honest, relevant film portrait of adolescence in ages.
The drama is scaled to just the right size: kids get into trouble or inadvisable situations, but there are no major melodramatics. We see them in their natural habitat.
James Franco's collection of autobiographical short stories is adapted into a remarkably evocative film by Gia Coppola, granddaughter of Francis.
The story tends to meander but the kids' ups and downs are delicately observed and the performances, especially from Roberts, are never less than believable.
The director Gia Coppola (granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola) gets under the skin of protagonists who seem like pampered, listless delinquents on the surface but who all turn out to be lost souls.
Palo Alto might not be the cream of the teen movie crop, but there's evidence here that the reputation of Coppola clan - which is now entering its third generation of directors - is in safe hands.
This dreamy tale of wasted youth provides a familiar yet authentic portrait of the teenage experience.
All of this is potentially irritating to say the least, and yet, despite the junior star entitlement and teen-angst cliches, the film is unexpectedly engaging.
Gia Coppola's debut about the teen experience has a lyricism that transcends James Franco's mediocre source.
The four stars all give solid, nuanced performers, but it's Roberts whose the stand out - capturing the bewidlerment of adolescence perfectly.
What separates this from a pack of high school dramas is the isolation everyone feels, as well as the lack of sensationalism when it comes to portraying their acts of rebellion.
With a distinct visual sensibility, Gia proves she's one more Coppola to watch.
It might not feel fresh but Palo Alto feels real, honest and moving. An impressive debut by an exciting new talent.
it holds together through the performances and a stylistic integrity; Coppola's voice is quiet but firm.
I was particularly impressed by Jack Kilmer and Nat Wolff. Those two central performances are very strong.
The performances are excellent and the result is an altogether sympathetic, if not entirely original film, from the latest member of a talented movie dynasty.
Coppola clearly has the filmmaking gene. Further, by collaborating with James Franco (on whose stories the film is loosely based), she injects much-needed adult counterpoint. The casting is mostly good.
