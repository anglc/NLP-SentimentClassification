A dramatization of what Robinson did and what it required, 42 will not disappoint.
It's not easy to play a stoic, but Boseman anchors the movie, and when he smiles, 42, already such a warm story of such cold times, gets even brighter.
The style of the film, lush and traditional, is nothing special, but the takeaway, a daily struggle for dignity, is impossibly moving.
A square, uninventive, but detailed and stirring bio-pic devoted to the two years in an athlete's life that changed a nation.
"This is a competent but mostly unexceptional film about a most extraordinary man."
A hero without imperfections can be problematic. But Jackie's nobility is more than well-earned, and tarnishing it for the sake of balance would be churlish. Besides, there's enough evil at loose among the white characters.
Boseman gives a potentially star-making performance, while Ford, at 70, segues smoothly from firm-jawed action hero to elder-statesman character actor.
It comes with a smooth burnished period look, and it tells a smooth and burnished story. Helgeland has good intentions but not much new to say about a real-life hero who wears his nobility and torment mostly as symbols.
The story isn't much more than a hit parade of "Shut up, racist" moments -- Alan Tudyk's opposing manager just oozes with venomous talk -- but its blunt force is enough to get the job done.
As a fond gesture to a country coming out of the dark ages, 42 is a good-hearted attempt at Robinson's story regardless of the historical realities it chose to gloss over.
42 seems savvier than it tends to let on. A stiff production, it's still enlivened, as it were, by the hilarious stiffness of Ford.
42 pitches an old-fashioned, spiritually uplifting sports drama at the same time it hits a resonant and timely home run for social equality.
42 is a solid crowd-pleaser about courage, endurance, justice and tolerance, but also about love: Robinson's love for his wife, the bromance between Robinson and Rickey, and their love for the game of baseball.
The film does tell a moving story and delivers a worthwhile message about the importance of turning the other cheek.
While the film leaves out the civil rights movement that played a role in making Branch Rickey's mind up that segregated baseball was done, it is still first-rate. Family entertainment of the best kind.
An old-fashioned mix of baseball nostalgia and social conscience
A sweeping, solid biopic that's nicely acted and evocative of its time, place and prejudice.
It's a moving, involving film that's packed with both snappy characters and a real sense of momentous history.
