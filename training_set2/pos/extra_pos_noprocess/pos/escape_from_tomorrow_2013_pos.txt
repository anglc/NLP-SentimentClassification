An incredible feat of satirical culture-jamming and gonzo movie-making, Escape from Tomorrow, for better or worse, won't be forgotten by those who agree to buy the ticket and take the ride
Anyone with a filmmaking background should watch the movie to see what real guerrilla filmmaking can accomplish.
The more Escape From Tomorrow lingers in the mind, the more disturbing and fascinating its implications on modern American culture become.
Cleverly shot guerrilla-style in Disney's Florida and California theme parks, this offbeat thriller is an exercise in relentlessly inventive filmmaking, vividly proving that pure imagination can overcome a micro-budget.
It's not so much disrespectful to 'Uncle Walt' and his beloved creations as it is honest about the primal urges and shameful desires that motivated the myths and fairy tales that inspired many of Disney's more famous projects in the first place.
Not quite demented enough, but it scores major points for degree of difficulty and treating a Disney World vacation as the surreal nightmare it sometimes is.
Less provocative for its assault on the false ideals of corporate-controlled family fun than its clever repurposing of many of the same German expressionist and gothic horror tropes that are at the root of much Disney iconography.
In a world of corporate moviemaking, Escape From Tomorrow is the ultimate unstudio project. It says that when you wish upon a star, you may land a couple of sexy, underage French schoolgirls.
It's a fascinating hypothesis, entertainingly told, and we can forgive the script some of its narrative lapses as we admire the sheer chutzpah of the on-the-fly guerrilla filmmaking it took to complete the project.
Even if this ride leaves us wanting more, it's impossible not to marvel at the exceptional craftsmanship behind its construction.
