Happily, there's a good deal of fun if you like things crashing violently into each other and out of warp-drive at regular intervals.
The conceptual sci-fi of the original series is nowhere to be found, though you might enjoy watching the skinny young actors approximate their counterparts from the 60s; Chris Pine is especially good as Captain Kirk.
While the action is often electric, it's the relationships that matter. That, and a lippy regard for a cultural legacy.
The film is, for whatever else it might be, one of the funniest of the Star Trek entries.
The 9/11-style attack on London at the film's beginning is followed by backstory upon cover story and bright rhetoric soars and false flags are planted. They darkly wave. Political opportunity is not wasted on ready opportunists.
Star Trek Into Darkness still manages to be an even more enjoyable film than its precursor.
In terms of sheer spectacle, there's no denying that it delivers. For all the build-up, hype, and hope leading up to the film, it's just a shame there isn't a whole lot more.
The effects are exhilarating, even in these jaded post-3D days, and there are enough action set-pieces, humour and character development to distract from a plot that isn't exactly sci-fi's final frontier.
Cumberbatch, with his otherworldly aura of menace and basso profundo rumble of voice, makes a worthy and memorable Big Bad in the annals of Trek lore.
It's generally a lot of fun, but it's exhausting, and the busyness only somewhat disguises the fact that the story doesn't entirely make sense.
Not as audacious or exciting as its predecessor but this sequel is still a fun summer ride.
...a terminally perfunctory followup that just barely gets the job done...
... a summer film that dimly reminds viewers of what it used to be - and could be again - while still being little more than a rollercoaster ride.
There's really very little to complain about in this warp-speed sequel.
so enjoyable that it becomes easy to forget that virtually everything in the film is a riff or spin on something we (including only casual Star Trek fans) have already seen
Thrilling if not exactly groundbreaking fun...yet something is missing this time around.
Moment to moment, it's as entertaining, rousing and visually impressive as any recent science-fiction action epic, but the script is cratered with illogical motivations and plot holes large enough to swallow Classic Trek's Doomsday Machine.
Even old-school Trekkers will enjoy this voyage.
J.J. Abrams' sequel is smart, fun, witty, essential sci-fi.
It feels a little "been there, done that" but it still entertains.
