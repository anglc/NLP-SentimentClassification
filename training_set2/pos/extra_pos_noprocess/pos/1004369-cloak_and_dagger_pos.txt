Old-fashioned espionage tale.
Starring Gary Cooper and Lili Plamer, Fritz Lang's WWII melodrama is one of the first Hollywood pictures to deal with the global threats of the atomic bomb.
The ugly ruthlessness on both sides of the conflict attests to Lang's pragmatic refusal to pit simple "good" versus "evil"
Much longer and less focused that You Only Live Once, it's still a vintage Lang picture and worth seeing.
