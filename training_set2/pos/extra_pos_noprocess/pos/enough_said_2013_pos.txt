These are the subjects that Holofcener does exceptionally well -- the myopia, vanity and insecurities of the moderately privileged.
Enough Said is Nicole Holofcener's best yet - it's what we wanted from the new Bridget Jones book, a smart comedy about dating in your 50s.
Enough Said is a romantic comedy about hurting the people you love, who you want to love - and making mistakes that may be impossible to recover from.
In the terse space film provides, Holofcener capturing her characters deftly. We know their fears, needs, lonesomeness. We trust the cars they drive, the food they eat, the rooms they keep tidy, or not.
What a concept -- an adult romantic comedy that's equally wise and playful, with mold-breaking performances by James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
The easy chemistry between Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini is wonderfully charming - you're rooting for them even as the falsehoods pile up and the poison begins to flow.
A slate of great performances cap off a compelling look at the way we build up and destroy the very relationships we want to engage in.
How it all plays out, even without the unexpected layer of wistful Gandolfini remembrance, is sad and funny at the same time.
Dreyfus and Gandolfini generate chemistry aplenty!
How the two deal with this situation is the crux of the story and the reactions are quite real and believable.
As a romantic comedy for grown-ups, Enough Said is something of a refreshing rarity. Both Gandolfini and JLD are wonderful, as is Nicole Holofcener's naturalistic dialogue. Enough Said.
A wonderful, original film, and it's never a distraction for one second that the two participants are played by people as iconic as Tony Soprano and Elaine Benes.
Great acting and smart dialogue are a killer combination. This touching, wise and spiky romance really crawls under your skin.
The film contains Gandolfini's final lead role, but his performance is cherishably un-final: easy, open and insisting on nothing, it's the work of a man who is just getting started.
Helping anchor affairs, though, is the bear-like Gandolfini, who brings charm and gravitas to a movie that might otherwise have seemed very superficial.
As wonderful as Gandolfini is here, Louis-Dreyfus is a revelation as the motherly yet self-denying Eva.
The strong point of the film is the writing by Nicole Holofcener ("Friends With Money"), who also directs this film. The dialog is smart and witty, with loads of funny one-liners and funny situations.
raises some serious issues of relationships
Slow-burning adult drama full of chuckles derived from well-written characters and top-notch acting...
...a perceptively funny romantic comedy about the responsibility that comes with loving another.
No matter how he looks in the film, Gandolfini's Albert is so unbelievably sweet and sincere and nice that it's impossible not to be charmed by him, and to wonder what might have been.
James Gandolfini will be missed. He could play a brute, as in 'Killing Them Softly,' or, as he does here in 'Enough Said,' a lovable, albeit flawed, regular guy. Either way, you cared about the characters into whom the late Gandolfini breathed life.
A rom-com that's actually, miraculously both romantic and comedic.
Enough Said is [director Nicole Holofcener's] best, most abrasive, yet touching film thus far. It's a knowing deep-dive into impulses that are stupid, fragile, selfish and deluded as two people try forming post-relationship relationships.
It's been about fifteen years since Julia Louis-Dreyfus last graced the big screen; an absence I hadn't even realised. That's on me. Having now witnessed her comeback effort, Enough Said, it's an absence I pray we never have to endure again.
