Can't wait to see what Lake Bell the filmmaker does next.
Like her character, Bell has made herself a contender in a male-dominated industry. And a damn funny one at that.
It's an exhilarating comic rush called In a World... and in it Lake Bell spins inspired lunacy around the subject of, among other things like family dysfunction, sexual healing and female empowerment, voiceovers.
A clever, likable comedy that sends up sexism, satirizes Hollywood, examines family ties and features a surprisingly tender romance at its core
An indie comedy as surprisingly tender and wise as it is deftly wise-cracking.
A fascinating look into the realm of voice over performance.
Very funny semi-satirical look at the bitchy, male-dominated world of movie trailer voice over people.
Writer-director Lake Bell is also the star of this quick-witted beguiling comedy of female identity, family ties and an unseen but fiercely competitive aspect of the film business.
The entire cast operates at the top of their game. Yet it's Bell who is undeniably the main attraction.
Though she had to write, direct, and produce the damn thing herself, Bell finally has a film that puts her full range of comedic, rom-com-ready abilities on display.
It will gently settle into the undistinguished ranks of history's perfectly okay works of art. I won't sing it's praises, but I don't regret watching it either.
Father-daughter dramedy about an aspiring voiceover artist eager to follow in her deep-voiced daddy's footsteps.
While certainly funny and goofy, In A World... also imparts an important message about the power of voice, and Bell is clearly a voice to be heard.
What pleasure then to find an August release that's built around real, identifiable humans, and sports a complicated but lovably flawed woman at its center.
Although In a World... won Bell a screenwriting award at the Sundance Film Festival, what's more compelling is how well this low-key comedy exhibits her charms as an actress.
Much of the humour here is barbed and cynical.
Take notice Hollywood, your next most promising triple threat has arrived with one of the freshest and funniest comedies this year.
Actress Lake Bell's smart and funny feature-directing debut In a World... juggles sex farce, feminist critique, family conflict and showbiz satire pretty deftly.
This smart, funny comedy is not just about voice-overs, it is about the massive egos of men who tend to lose sight of what is really important (family for instance) in the pursuit of their careers.
A comic director finds her voice
"unfocused and erratic, but with an undeniable charm"
Lake a triple threat with "In a World..."
Bell's revelation is that females (even high-achieving ones) are surprisingly likely to use a voice that suggests they're an ickle-wickle pushover.
One of the most charming and delightful movies in a very long time.
