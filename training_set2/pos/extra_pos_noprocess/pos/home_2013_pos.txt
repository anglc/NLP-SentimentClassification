Oliver is off to a promising start. Let's hope it's enough to get his next go-round a wider theatrical release.
This movingly understated drama benefits from strong performances and incisive characterizations.
The great achievement in writer-director Jono Oliver's poignant, superb debut, "Home," lies in the balance between the film's empathy for those like Jack who seek independence and its compassion for others who may need care indefinitely.
The casting director needs a raise.
Remains character-driven throughout and doesn't have a moment that rings false, pretentious or contrived. Gbenga Akinnagbe gives a genuinely heartfelt performance. If there were any justice, he'd get some awards attention.
A smart, engaging and superbly acted indie drama that knows and shows its title can be not just a physical place but a state of settled mind.
