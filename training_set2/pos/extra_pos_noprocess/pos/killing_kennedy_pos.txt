Ginnifer Goodwin as Jackie and Michelle Trachtenberg as Oswald's wife acquit themselves well in this solidly watchable, quickly forgettable dramatic snapshot of indelible history.
You won't come away from it with any new answers, but it's a useful reminder of why the drama of that day has transfixed Americans for half a century.
Killing Kennedy is subversive in a great way. The more the pathology of Oswald is developed...the more it resembles what propels many conspiracy theorists.
Killing Kennedy easily could have been twice its length, the better to add both nuance and context. Instead it's a watchable film with many missing parts, a broadly drawn Classics Illustrated version of what happened and why.
While there's little surprise in how it unfurls, it will still reign as the best, most attractive re-enactment of the event on tis 50th anniversary - and there will still be a lot of them.
NatGeo really should have made Killing Kennedy a feature-length theatrical release, as the 95-minute run time makes the story feel too compressed.
The pace and the performances carry the film.
Rothhaar captures the wild-eyed intensity of a man on the edge, then the focus of a man with a horrific plan to execute. Despite ourselves, we root for a different outcome, which may be the most interesting accomplishment of all.
Killing Kennedy offers a fresh, if not biased take on the lives of two men that unexpectedly intersects and changes the nation forever. Will Rothhaar and Michelle Trachtenberg give the performance of their careers.
