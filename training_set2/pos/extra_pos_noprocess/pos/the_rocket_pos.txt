In some ways, it feels like a throwback to many '80s teen movies, where everything comes down to a competition at the end, and the hero will finally get the chance to prove his worth.
It follows a search for personal salvation while painting a portrait of Laotian life that's both revealing and relatable.
A powerful, deeply moving drama about a young boy who comes to terms with the tragedies that have befallen his family by creating a thing of beauty - a gorgeous, high-flying rocket emitting triumphant bursts of color - out of refuse left by the war.
Mordaunt doesn't always succeed at balancing the sentimental, the political and the ethnographic, but at its strongest the story is a seamless melding of history's dark undertow and a child's indefatigable optimism.

A pretty, somewhat sleepy and finally strange once-upon-a-time tale...
A vital fairytale about a ten-year-old Laotian boy whose family thinks he's been cursed since birth, "The Rocket" is an unlikely heartwarmer.
Vivid, travelogue-y village pic.
Try not to fall off the edge of your seat during the film's nail-biting final scenes.
Despite some dark edges, this crowd-pleasing Laotian drama is far too heartwarming for its own good.
It is a likable piece of work whose gentleness is an interesting contrast to the grim and even tragic subject matter.

This utterly charming, fable-like coming of age tale will live longer in the hearts and minds of audiences.
A simple but charming, affecting and thought-provoking story, rich in atmosphere and local history, and beautifully acted by its young leads.
A Lao-brow fable that resonates richly with the realities of globalisation.
A stirring, lushly-constructed celebration of youthful spirit.
This strikingly original feelgood fable is artfully balanced between director Kim Mordaunt's roots in documentary and a spellbinding magic realism.
A first [feature] for both Mordaunt's filmography and the country's catalogue of internationally-released titles and it's difficult to imagine a debut being stronger.
The Rocket won't change anyone's world, but as a pleasantly sweet piece of world cinema, it's still worth seeing and being charmed by.
A coming-of-age fable driven by naturalistic performances and a poignant atmosphere of loss.
This engaging fable oscillates between feel-good spunk and unexpected tragedy, and hits the right notes along the way.
