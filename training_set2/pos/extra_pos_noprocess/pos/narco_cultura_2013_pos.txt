Photojournalist Shaul Schwarz's powerful documentary Narco Cultura gets inside the world of two men who, in very different ways, inhabit this horror.
An eye-opening examination of Mexico's blood-soaked drug war and its unsettling pop-culture side effects, Narco Cultura is as overwhelming as it is absorbing.
This haunting documentary contrasts songs saluting Mexican drug lords as heroic bandits with the harrowing reality of life in murder-stained Juarez.
This dispassionate but devastating film looks at the drug wars from two very different but chillingly complementary perspectives.
After watching "Narco Cultura," it's hard to imagine any "recreational" user of pot wondering whether the joint he or she just smoked isn't soaked in human blood.
Narco Cultura is terrifying, and impossible to forget.
Right out of the headlines, "Narco Cultura" is a documentary that offers insights into the world of drugs and music, north and south of the U.S.-Mexico border.
This documentary film opens with grim scenes of blood and death, and it doesn't get any better after that.
It's impossible to watch Shaul Schwarz's grueling documentary about the Mexican drug wars and their influence on the whole of Mexican society without wondering how on earth such a hell on earth could have erupted right in our back yard.
Schwartz doesn't flinch with his camera. "Narco Cultura" contains footage that is deeply disturbing on a number of levels.
Tubas, accordions and beheadings. Hmmm...
The soundtrack of your death.
Mexico's drug war has spawned death and destruction rivaling the largest military conflicts and the show is just beginning.
The Mexican drug wars have claimed approximately 60,000 lives in the last six years. You can purchase the soundtrack on iTunes.
Although it would have benefited from some expert testimony, the film does capture the Mexican equivalent of gangsta rap.
...Narco Cultura is gripping, gruesome and arresting; a disquieting look a pop (sub)-culture phenomenon that is mushrooming all over the United States and Latin America.
