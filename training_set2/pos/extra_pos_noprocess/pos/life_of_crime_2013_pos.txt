An amiable diversion, though not a terribly memorable one. Elmore Leonard aficionados longing for a truly worthy sendoff of the master crime writer will have to look ahead toward the upcoming final season of Justified, and cross their fingers.
Thanks to Leonard's source material and the outstanding cast, it works.
An abiding insignificance looms over the film, but it's a fun 98 minutes.
Though a decidedly down-market adaptation of the great Elmore Leonard crime novel Switch, Life of Crime is never down-and-out.
It's good, solid Leonard, which, for me at least, is a cosy, comfortable, and extremely fun place to be for ninety-eight minutes.
Fun, throwaway, time-killing crime comedy romp.
Despite sudden, and uncomfortable, tone shifts and a confusing plot twist, the film is anchored by strong performances from its cast, particularly Aniston.
The script is a nice mixture of suspense and black comic bumbling about.
Schechter's adaptation feels more cautiously reverent than inspired, denying Life of Crime of snap, style, and, most importantly, a sense of danger.
Appealing enough to pass, with Schechter locating a casual rhythm to a pressurized situation, relying on the writer's way with characters and twists to feed into well-acted adventures with criminals and the hostages who love them.
This is a droll and well-observed comedy thriller that recreates the 1970s in convincing fashion while retaining enough of a sense of menace to avoid ever drifting off into whimsy.
Schechter works hard at making the picture look like a genuine 1970s artefact, only to end up repeating David O Russell's American Hustle and Tarantino (again).
A likeable, if predictable, black comedy that feels like a Tarantino movie made by well-meaning committee.
Although the plot itself is nothing special, this kidnapping comedy keeps the audience entertained by filling every scene with outrageous characters and twisty interaction.
If you're in the market for a workaday crime story, Schechter's film fulfils some of its obligations. You might just wish it had more life.
