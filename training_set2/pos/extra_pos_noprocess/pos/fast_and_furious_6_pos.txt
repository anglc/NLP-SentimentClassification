Just as the plot threatens to run out of gas, Lin rescues the film with a spate of vastly ridiculous and therefore enjoyable set-pieces, most of which involve means of conveyance designed to make the cars look puny.
Some of the action sequences are insane. No, really. Absurd, impossible, physics defying, triage-required stuff. No matter. That's the foolish rush of a franchise that must go faster and faster and furiouser and furiouser.
Ludicrous, but undeniably fun and surprisingly affectionate, this is really all you could ask of a car crash movie, and more.
Furious Six continues on in the same vein as its predecessor, and may just be my favorite of the lot.
Vin Diesel makes gravel audible-there's one reason he didn't choose "Vin Cashmere" as his nom de zoom-with elongated, not quite drawled delivery of lines like "L'es go for a li'l ride."
Adrenaline packed petrol-head entertainment.
A worthy, nitrous-blasting addition to a franchise that may not be so fresh any more but is as fast and furious as ever.
No one's going to pretend this is art, but it makes sense commercially. The fights and chases are superbly choreographed and genuinely spectacular.
a movie that delivers exactly what it promises
Shamelessly traffics in mind-numbing contrivance and formula and owns them with such stylish verve it doesn't matter a damn.
There is a lot of hollow talk about codes of honor and some really corny dialogue and delivery, but the light tone and breakneck pace make these things easy to forgive. Lin has become a top-flight action director.
Souped-up action filmmaking at its most unabashedly entertaining.
A satisfying next step in a series which brings out the little boy and his Hot Wheels cars in all of us.
Director Justin Lin once again ups the ante as cars, motorbikes, tanks and even planes roar across the screen in dazzling displays of stunt choreography.
With an apparent brief to set a new franchise record for on-screen vehicular mayhem, the film's signature sequence involves the car-crunching daylight pursuit of a tank as it powers down the wrong side of a Spanish freeway. It's magnificently nuts.
