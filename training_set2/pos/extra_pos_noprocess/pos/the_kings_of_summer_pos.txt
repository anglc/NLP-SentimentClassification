Coming on like Stand by Me meets Son of Rambow, the boys' adventure is essentially dreamy indie-teen wish-fulfilment.
A warm and affectionate comedy about that last great summer when you're 13 or 14 and you don't realize just how much your life is about to change and things will never be the same.
This willfully eccentric tale about teenage boys in suburban Ohio fleeing their families to live in the deep woods plays like an erratic comic revue slapped together at theater camp.
In its small, independent way, "The Kings of Summer" rules.
If you were lucky enough to grow up near the woods, you'll see how true the movie is to the tenor of adolescent exploration. This is a kid's film in the best sense of the word, not a movie for kids, but a great story about being a kid.
With a good helping of humor and engaging performances, The Kings of Summer makes for a delightfully entertaining coming of age tale.
Rich in suburban subtext, The Kings Of Summer is a coming-of-age indie movie full of poignancy, charm and strong performances.
Thanks in no small part to its trio of hugely likeable teenage leads, the film breezes along, mixing comedy with drama to often seamless effect, while exploring the kind of issues that viewers can all find relatable.
Quirky, funny, occasionally too whimsical and at times implausible, it's rather like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn meeting the cast of Rebel Without a Cause.
This is the kind of American independent comedy-drama that restores our faith in the cinema, combining a talented cast, witty direction and a razor-sharp script to reboot the coming-of-age genre.
The Kings of Summer can't quite decide between dysfunctional family drama, the aesthetics of floaty Americana, Goonies-brand adventurism and outbursts of rip-roaring comedy.
The reasons for raves at the Sundance Film Festival? The film's charm, freshness, wit and skewiness of vision.
It lollops along to its own lazy drumbeat, perfectly evoking that too-brief time of life when you could pass the evenings drunk on stolen beer and all the spare time you could dream of.
A sunny and reasonably funny coming-of-ager from Sundance-ratified debutant Jordan Vogt-Roberts.
The spirit of Stand By Me lives on in The Kings of Summer, a poignant and frequently hilarious coming-of-age film about three teenage friends yearning for freedom and independence.
First love, a friend's powerless deception and a perfectly timeless score, credited to Ryan Miller, keep things moving along in a feel-good kind of way.
The first two-thirds of the movie felt rather special, while the last third less so. Still, it has its charms, the kids are appealing and it's worth catching.
The kids are superb - the ups and downs of the Joe/Patrick friendship ring true, while oddball Moises Arias steals scenes left, right and off-centre.
A hugely enjoyable, acutely observed and frequently hilarious coming-of-age drama with a delightful script, likeable characters and terrific performances from a note-perfect cast.
