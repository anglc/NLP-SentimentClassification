"Filth" lives up to its title and then some, but a no-holds performance by James McAvoy is reason enough to watch.
Credit the filmmakers with descending persuasively into the swampy squalor of a diseased mind. If you're in the mood to go there with them, Filth offers an indecently bracing wallow.
Unlike Jude Law's similarly offensive title character in Dom Hemingway, McAvoy is given a far better story to work from.
This is one of those movies where much of the non-Scottish audience would need subtitles and a Scottish slang dictionary. It is brimming with profanity and explicit sex scenes and an amazing performance by James McAvoy.
The film's pat, unsatisfying resolution ultimately doesn't detract from it's minute-to-minute pleasures.
Based on a novel by Irvine Welsh, Jon S. Baird's Filth is delightfully anarchic, forthright in its crassness, and, despite a general lack of thrust, exhilarating to watch.
McAvoy... gives it his all, fearless, energetic, and lunatic.
The diseased storyline and twisted propulsion of Filth make it one of the most exciting movies in years, even as the plot eventually sinks into explanations that feel more contrived than necessary.
If this film feels dated, its because director Jon S. Baird adheres to Danny Boyle's style, with all the visual flourishes and accelerated editing that seem mandatory when translating Welsh's prose.
