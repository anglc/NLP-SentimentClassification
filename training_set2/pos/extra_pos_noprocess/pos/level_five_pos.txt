A poetic if occasionally opaque film essay on the 1945 Battle of Okinawa.
"Level Five," a passionate and cerebral science-fiction adventure ... belongs equally to the past, the present and the future.
A richly digressive, provocative meditation on the cross-currents of technology, engagement with history and wounded national identity ...
By using Laura as an avatar, Marker actually helps us see the visuals and their knotty meanings much more clearly.
"Level Five" plays like a lost CD-ROM rediscovered in some thrift-store bargain bin.
The theories in "Level Five" simultaneously thrive in realms of computer science, ethnography, and cognitive psychology, while the picture remains cloaked by the emotional weight of a historical tragedy that marked an entire nation.
Already a cult film nearly 20 years old, Level Five makes its U.S. theatrical debut, and the wait has turned the viewing experience into something even more meditative than director Chris Marker might have intended.
Like every other film Marker made, it's an exemplary and resonant address on the life of the mind and the life outside of that one.
...[Level Five] effortlessly anticipated the aesthetic and thematic shifts of 21st-century cinema, even as it addressed the history and legacy of the 20th.
Tension is explored between the medium and the message - namely, how history becomes selectively fashioned for the medium through which it is depicted rather than the other way around.
This film demands every cell of your cerebellum, but its compelling surreality is hard to shake off.
Level Five pictorializes the cruel moment when curiosity encounters tragedy, and the all-too-human abandonment of interest that can follow.
The most extraordinarily contemporary thing about Marker's intricate matrix (in a William Gibson rather than a Wachowskis sense of the concept) is how beautifully it lines up with and enlarges the contexts of recent films.
Impactful at getting at little known historical gems throughout.
