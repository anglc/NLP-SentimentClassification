Rogen and Streisand are reasonably funny together, though Rogen, always best when he's angry, is crowded into the role of a well-mannered straight man.
A breezy, funny and warm road-trip comedy.
The Guilt Trip is clearly targeted at older audiences less than receptive to the crude jokes that made Seth Rogen famous.
The laughs are gentle, of the chuckle rather than laugh-out-loud variety and they're plentiful enough to overlook the episodic sequences.
Rogen's deadpan misery meshes well with Streisand's oblivious idiocy, making the laughs roll in.
It never quite delivers juggernaut-sized laughs, but the sharp-tongued sparring between the two leads pops and fizzes throughout, with Streisand in particular showing she's still an intuitive and naturalistic comedian.
Streisand has lost little of her gawky, pesky touch in comedy, while Rogen knows just how to be the charmingly daft slob.
Rogen plays the science nerd Andrew, who has just invented an organic cleaning product and is taking a cross-country trip to find a buyer. In a moment of weakness, he invites his meddling mother Joyce (Streisand).
Enjoyable mother-son road movie that swerves the potential potholes of broad or outrageous comedy in favour of an engaging, emotionally convincing and ultimately moving portrait of the central relationship ...
Think of it as a Sunday drive, easy and breezy, with good company to pass the time.
Despite the odds, both stars strike a few sparks in Anne Fletcher's slight comedy.
Some actors you'd pay to watch read the phonebook; turns out it's worth paying to see Streisand eat a steak.
