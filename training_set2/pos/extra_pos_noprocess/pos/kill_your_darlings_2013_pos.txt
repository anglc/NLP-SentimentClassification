Daniel Radcliffe is back in a pair of nerdy specs as Allen Ginsberg in this sincere, heartfelt film about how the gay beat poet found his voice
Bursting with hipster attitude and New York atmosphere, the fact-based "Kill Your Darlings" is a coming-of-age chronicle that morphs into a crime story without missing a beat.
You don't need to know the Beats to understand "Kill Your Darlings," you just need to know the twinkling promise, and dark turns, of life.
"Kill Your Darlings" is a true-crime murder mystery, a love letter to the wild-living artists of the Beat Generation, and a portrait of the artist as an adolescent.
Dramatizing a passion for the written word on film can be tricky, but in his feverish Kill Your Darlings, first-time director John Krokidas brings creative desire to life with vigor and emotion.
The best thing about the enthralling, super-smart Kill Your Darlings is director John Krokidas's ability to capture the excitement of young men's minds on fire.
Kill Your Darlings is by no means perfect, but it's an ambitious and promising first film that gives a handful of young actors the chance to work with a director who has a great deal on his mind.
A convincing, evocative drama that captures a key moment in history with aplomb.
Kill Your Darlings underwhelms on several fronts, but it's difficult to dislike a movie when you find yourself liking everyone in it.
A very well-made film that gives us a peek into the formation of several future gay icons.
Hooked me from the first moment and kept me hooked all the way through.
A strong and well observed fifties period piece, Kill Your Darlings brilliantly captures both the heady sense of privilege, and the decadent whiff of The Beat Generation's brief and blazing demimonde.
A powerful and insightful film about two controversial young writers who were never satisfied with the status quo and sought to change it.
A Bracing Look at the Beats
Kill Your Darlings weaved the mythical origins of the beat generation into a fiercely engaging drama about finding yourself amidst crises of identity, sexuality and art.
Daniel Radcliffe and star-the-making Dane DeHaan deliver superb performances that tap into their character's respective insecurities.
It's less about the flesh and blood Carr than using his in-movie inner-conflict and alleged moral cowardice to underline the travails of an ascendent and newly liberated Ginsberg.
The period recreation is impressive, but the tone is non-descript, despite the strong efforts from an obviously dedicated cast. No question, though, that Beat fans will love it a lot more than they did Walter Salles' inert On The Road.
Sexy and self-aware, with a 1940s-style Brat Pack feel ...
