Andersen's inspired ruminations about his city as a filming location and as a repository for other filmmakers' daydreams and nightmares.
One of the great films of the century to date, poignant and affecting.
CalArts professor Thom Andersen poured a lifetime of moviegoing (and his own complex affection for the city he calls home) into this revelatory two-part documentary, a film that trains you to look at things askew.
Using well-chosen clips from roughly 200 films, many of them obscure, Andersen makes a powerful and impassioned case for reassessing his beloved city.
It's like being squired through town by a wisecracking cabbie with a PhD in semiotics.
Brilliantly discursive, filled with intriguing detours that follow connections only the director's mind could make, Los Angeles Plays Itself, will please natives of this city more than any other.
Ten years on, we can finally call this film a classic. It's an unparalleled work of social and cultural study. The new, remastered cut means it looks better than ever.
The doc bears repeated viewing, even when one winces at some of Andersen's assertions.
Arguably the best movie about movies ever made.
An ultimate movie clip junkie film, a video store fantasy with a pulse and a brain.
An ingenious, if somewhat dry and overlong, account of how the movies have depicted the various textures, tensions and ambiguities that make up the City of Angels.
... as provocative a movie as I've seen in the last couple years...
[A] passionate call for a more accurate account of the diverse struggles, hopes, and joys to be found throughout the city of angels.
Its formidable intellectual heft aside, there's great pleasure to be had in just looking at this guided tour of L.A, fact and fiction.
The commentary alternates between witty insight and opinionated bunk, but it's always fun -- and a must-see for movie buffs.
I will dispense with my objections by saying that, with so much on his mind, Andersen sometimes organizes the work in the manner of a saloon orator: 'And another thing.' Apart from that, though, I like pretty much everything he's done.
An intellectually rigorous but enjoyable essay on the way the city of angels has become Hollywood's favourite location.
