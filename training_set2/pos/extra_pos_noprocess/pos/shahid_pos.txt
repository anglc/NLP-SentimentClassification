Mr. Mehta has done something difficult. He has made a film of conviction that's neither plodding nor preachy.
Mehta's drama establishes strong humanistic qualities and a deeply personal protagonist before launching into the courtroom fireworks.
The film, which apparently was made by Mehta to battle growing negative allegations against the late Shahid, includes numerous fictionalized moments. Solidly acted by all, Shahid would no doubt have benefited from a more documentary feel.
