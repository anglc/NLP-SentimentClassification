Powerful and humbling, this 2013 drama is worth every minute you're willing to give it.
A political and spiritual parable, but related with such subtle realism and incantatory rhythms that it is far more mysterious than didactic.
If the movie's universal themes don't impress, its specific details do.
More than four hours long, filmed in expansive takes with almost no close-ups and very few camera movements, Lav Diaz's "Norte, the End of History" is a tour de force of slow cinema.
Norte is formidable cinema that doesn't shy away from exploring history, philosophy, politics and religion at length. But it's also a story of three individuals, through whom these topics gain sharper focus.
You'd have to go back to Edward Yang's Yi-Yi to find a movie that approaches marathon-length running times yet still makes you wish it were twice as long.
Diaz has shaped his material with a mesmerizing rhythm, digital lenser Larry Manda's imagery often stunning.
As is often the case with three-hour-plus projects, a sense of Stockholm Syndrome kicks in, leaving us happy to roll along with real-time rhythms of meals and walks and chores.
Moments are electrifying - the spaces between them challenging.
Diaz is dealing with primal emotions in a contemplative, visually striking way.
It's bristling with plot and ideas. The story sprawls, but it also rivets.
Shot in blazing colour, this builds into an intense and emotional saga of evil, guilt and injustice.
Filipino maven Diaz delivers a bravura, literary human drama that does justice to its great source material.
Detailed, rich, complex filmmaking.
Patient and inquisitive viewers will surely find it a very rewarding experience, and one hopes it's not the last Lav Diaz film to make its way to these shores.
Masterly elements, for sure. Spurts of vivid violence and dialectical debate.
This is a classical tragedy of the modern Philippines and of global capitalism, a story of violence, hate, fear and love spread out on a colossal panorama which extends its reach into the realms of the spiritual and the supernatural.
Superb.
There are moments of staggering beauty and power on display here and yet there are also moments when it seems to be ambling around with no clear idea of where it wants to go.
