Matt Dillon and Kurt Russell may not make the most convincing half-brothers, but "The Art of the Steal" is a fairly amusing heist film with some sibling tension helping the story along.
An entertaining lark.
There's little that's unfamiliar about director Jonathan Sobol's switchbacking caper so he winningly cashes in on the strength of his cast, particularly Russell's world-weary con and a scene-stealing Stamp as the languidly insolent Brit.
The strenuous presentation might remind you of Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, but the boisterous script has some legitimately amusing moments along the way ...
Kurt Russell returns in this blithely unambitious caper flick.
"The Art of the Steal" won't trick audiences into thinking they've seen anything new, but it's just clever enough to keep them distracted from realizing that they haven't.
A movie that scores by way owning its familiarity. If the plot specifics are basically a yawn, director Sobol wisely keeps seriousness at bay, infusing his effort with a springy energy.
There are a handful of actors working today whose mere presence justifies whatever film they are in. Kurt Russell is at the top of a very short list for me, and has been so for decades.
