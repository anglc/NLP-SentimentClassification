The Christmas miracle of this movie is that Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever isn't the worst Christmas movie ever.
If the people behind Sharknado could make a movie about Santa, it would look something like this.
This movie is definitely worth the watch if you need a little cheese added to your Christmas.
