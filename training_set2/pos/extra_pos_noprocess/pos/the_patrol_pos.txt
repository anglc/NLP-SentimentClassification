The wearing tedium of conflict is effectively evoked, broken occasionally by bursts of violence that are rightly harrowing.
A rough experience, bracingly free of the usual macho posturing that characterizes movies about the military, and a compassionate and humane portrait of modern soldiering.
First-time British writer-director Tom Petch makes a powerful impression with this tough, smart war movie on a shrewdly managed small scale, about a British army patrol in Afghanistan.
A well executed minor drama that casts a careful life on the inner lives of military personnel, and promises good things to come in terms of the young cast, and Tom Petch's future career.
This is an unsparing and occasionally bleak look at the frustrations of fighting an unwinnable war with inadequate gear.
It's a solid debut, with Petch's evocative location filming (in Morocco) and pyrotechnic flourishes belying his low budget.
