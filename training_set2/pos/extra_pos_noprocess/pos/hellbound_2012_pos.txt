An engaging, accessible documentary that explores the (truly) eternal questions, "Does hell exist? If so, who ends up there, and why?"
Hellbound will probably find favor mostly with a Christian-film audience when, if [director Kevin Miller] had cast a wider net, it might have had broader appeal.
[It gives] the little-served Christian market a thought-provoking alternative to smarmy features like "Fireproof."
Any admirer of good talk will be impressed by the scholasticism and pulpit-trained oratory here ...
A rich, thoughtful conversation-starter about changing notions of religious damnation, Hellbound? invades notoriously touchy territory with an open mind, steady focus and civil disposition.
After seeing this doc, the average sinning moviegoer may feel less apprehensive and less in need of an asbestos jumpsuit for the afterlife.
