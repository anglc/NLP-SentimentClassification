It's well performed, adequately eerie (with terrific lighting), superbly scored, and filled with enough heaving bosoms to pass muster. At the end of the day, that's all one can truly ask of a B-level fright film.
The lively and atmospheric but flawed horror pic might be routine and limited by its slack story, but it is entertaining and holds up better than most vampire pics.
These ain't the Doublemint twins. We're talking horror....Hammer style. "Twins of Evil" is the 1971 classic from Britain's Hammer Studios featuring Peter Cushing as the leader of a Puritan witch-hunting club.
The film offers more than just a gimmick, thanks to the shifting dynamics between the characters, the emphasis on evil at both ends of the spectrum, and a shot of witchcraft into the usual vampiric proceedings.
The true Twins of Evil are not the sisters but the puritan witch-burner, Gustav Weil, and the vampire aristocrat, Count Karnstein: The men have similarly cadaverous faces, and at one point are introduced by looming closeups that reinforce the resemblance.
... earns its place in the Hammer canon of cult horrors.
Even though time has since separated the film from its Playboy gimmick, TWINS still has a campy feel to it
