Polanski and Stewart reunite at the film's end to reminisce, but it's the original footage that thrills.
Weekend Of A Champion serves as a terrific primer on auto racing.
Weekend of a Champion begins as a motorsports movie but ends up a portrait of two wily elder statesmen who have survived into their seventies by skill, stealth and sheer luck.
Stewart, found here at the height of his prowess and celebrity, proves a rather charming and loquacious subject, long ago inured to the spotlight and thus comfortable indulging our interest with candor.
...fascinating insight into the mind of a champion at the height of his powers...a don't-miss film, even if you're not an auto racing aficionado, which I'm not.
An all-access pass into the past, this intimate behind-the-scenes documentary...is entrancing even for those of us whose familiarity with the sport begins and ends with the Indianapolis 500.
Weekend Of A Champion takes audiences close enough to the brink of oblivion to really drive home what a remarkable accomplishment that represents.
Stewart knows his stuff, but his confidence is accompanied by the lingering sense that something could go wrong at any moment.
Even when he's talking technical, as he mostly does, Stewart's engaging, no-nonsense good humour shines through.
The film is at its most fascinating when Jackie Stewart authoritatively and pedagogically discusses the nuances of his trade.
