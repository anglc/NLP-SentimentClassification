Invited to sit in the facing seat, we have long minutes to watch, listen and assess, considering who these pilgrims are and what, aside from worship, has really brought them here.
"Manakamana" is simple in conception, but the reactions it evokes in viewers will be complex and multifaceted.
"Manakamana" is a haunting experience, one that requires patience (and then some) but that offers spiritual, philosophical, and aesthetic rewards beyond the immediate power of words to describe.
The directors, Pacho Velez (who did the camera work) and Stephanie Spray (who recorded the sound), condense world history into the confined space of a glassed-in bubble.
By focusing on such a narrow slice of Nepali life, Ms. Spray and Mr. Velez have ceded any totalizing claim on the truth and instead settled for a perfect incompleteness.
Manakamana doesn't answer any questions, yet makes its point: Nepal, like the rest of our planet, is a picturesque but far from peaceable kingdom.
A two-hour film with Nepalese as its first language, no introduction, no narration and no dramatic arc sounds like a challenge, in much the same way that unshelled lobster is delicious: both require a little patience.
If only the viewing environment were more suited to casual contemplation, allowing the audience (like the passengers) to dip in and out of the car in 10-minute stretches.
A gimmicky observation of life in Nepal, this is one of those documentaries that offers the audience an experience rather than any actual information.
Manakamana works as a tone poem, a Warholian revel in the mundane and an ethnographic study of an isolated corner.
Though its subject matter doesn't seem particularly fun on the surface, Stephanie Spray and Pacho Velez's Manakamana is a sort of structural game, by turns contemplative and, yes, playful.
Boring? Absolutely not. Strangely revealing, meditative and funny? Yes, as passengers reveal themselves by costume, silence, chatter and posture, rising up through a hazy, green landscape into the clouds where Manakamana.
Multiple viewings simply allow for more diverse and creative readings of the material.
An intimate humanist experiment, the film provokes much delight in its playful structure.
A colourful portrait of Nepal as a country driven by ancient tradition, yet also embracing necessary change.
A purifying moviegoing experience...
A must-see, especially in a theater, where the lack of distractions makes it even more mesmerizing, a cinematic Rorschach test that lets you interpret the expressions on faces from halfway around the world.
It's hypnotic work with a terrific sense of cultural study and geography.
If you're prone to carsickness, this might not be the ideal movie for you. But as a meditation on the way human beings fill the silence - or choose not to - it's an amazing accomplishment.
For the curious viewer.
In the hands of Spray and Velez, the journey is far more important than the destination.
The beauty and rhythms of the fixed camera's highly specific focus builds a hypnotic group narrative of religion's possibility, the ways in which it can bring joy and peace.
This particular pilgrimage is both a privilege and a pleasure.
