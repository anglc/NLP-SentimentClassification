If Kevin Smith was stoned when he thought up his excellent walrusian nightmare, then marijuana is the best creative medicine.
If you're a Kevin Smith junkie, as I am, you'll appreciate the verbal pinwheels he spins around the horror genre in Tusk.
Tusk is a movie I like and would never recommend, which is actually par for the course when it comes to most of Kevin Smith's creative output.
Tusk is the monster stitched out of a horrific premise and Kevin Smith's brand of downright silliness.
Smith has always had a weakness for protracted dialogue, and in Parks he has a fitting muse.
The way Kevin Smith's mind works is a grotesque wonder to behold.
...an unholy insane mess of a movie. Yes, it is self-referential and self-aggrandizing in that peculiar self-deprecating way the writer-director has perfected.
