This is one of those rarities, an animated sequel that improves on the original.
Co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, who do Minion voices expertly, never let up on the laughs. A fart joke in 3-D may not be three times as wacky, but the high spirits of Despicable Me 2 are irresistible fun.
How do you tell a story about a bad guy who is no longer a bad guy? Despicable Me 2 embraces the dilemma and adds new ones.
As a sequel [it] stands level with the first film (also directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud), and may have the edge on it.
If you're looking for quality prepackaged, predigested Hollywood family fun this summer, you could do a lot worse than Despicable Me 2.
...a passable followup that's sure to amuse and entertain fans of the original.
Carrell's almost better this way, with his mugging fully abstracted by animation, whereas we start to miss Wiig's actual face.
Gru's villainy is replaced by a cloying fish-out-of-water mentality that is tortured by overuse of the minions characters. Still, the film is entertaining and has several wonderful scenes that almost make up the difference.
The minions are back and better than ever.
It's the zany goggle-wearing yellow-hued Minions who provide most of the film's chuckles and who justify the otherwise pointless 3D when they break the fourth wall at the start of the credits with a set of loopy antics.
The movie captures that magical mixture: naughtiness and goodness.
The only thing that really holds this sequel back... it just doesn't seem epic enough to be a "summer blockbuster"... then again, maybe that's a good thing...
Doesn't belong in the top ranks of animated fare but, like its predecessor, it contains enough humor, charm, and warmth to make it a solid family film.
THIS is what 3D should be.
A comical mash of cartoonish imagination and surreal detail that's just right for the mix of hyperkinetic humor and sentimental charm.
I think this is a fine animated comedy for kids, and parents can sit through it without despair. It just doesn't quite fit the adult audience quite as well as the first one did.
What a nice surprise: Gru is just as funny as a good guy. 'Despicable Me 2' is, believe it or not, a romance-focused romp that has its share of villains. This time around, though, Gru is not among them.
Ranks as one of the best animated sequels of all time.
If the first film was in some ways a re-imagining of Seuss, with a grinchy Gru's heart growing from two sizes too small to one too large, Despicable Me 2 continues his rehabilitation from complete societal outlier to minion-infested community fixture.
The assumption seems to be that the public can't get enough Minions. Despicable Me 2 sets out to test that assumption to its absolute limit.
