The movie bleakly emphasizes the sense of debilitating powerlessness of the average citizen without the means to bring anything but their vote to the ballot box.
If you have a shred of idealism left, it's hard to watch "Citizen Koch" without a mounting sense of despair and outrage over the influence that money has come to wield over modern elections.
"Citizen Koch" is preaching to the choir. Which might not be a pointless exercise, seeing how the choir failed to show up for the last midterm election in 2010, and might need extra motivation not to repeat that mistake this November.
Most of the movie is a backgrounder on the Citizens United case, in which a deeply divided Supreme Court opened the door to truckloads of campaign cash from tycoons and corporations.
If you value civic equality and civil liberties, Citizen Koch is a must see.
May not be the most smoothly organized documentary of the year, but it certainly fires a lot of arrows at its target.
Separate and distinct from being utter catnip for politicos, the dark lessons this engrossing nonfiction film holds... are terribly important ones.
Co-directors Carl Deal and Tia Lessin (Trouble the Water) cohesively illustrate what happens when the bad financial powers-that-be cannot be stopped.
Deal and Lessin's documentary isn't an anatomy of the so-called Kochtopus, nor is it a study of the Koch's business empire. A better title for this documentary might be "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Wisconsin."
The documentary "Citizen Koch" is uneven and scattershot at times, but when you're target is as big and fat as corporate money in politics, you can afford to be a little scattersot and still hit your mark.
