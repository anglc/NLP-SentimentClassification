A family implodes with a biting commentary on patriarchy.
"We Are What We Are" is such a patient, trusting film it may take you a while to figure out it's a horror film.
We Are What We Are doesn't waste time with cheap scares. Mickle keeps his story on a steady, slow simmer, transporting us minute by minute into the very heart of dread.
The movie stays elegantly restrained just long enough for the true horror of what they're doing to sink in.
A campy and sometimes elegant American Gothic horror story.
Another welcome entry in the ongoing revival of horror movies that rely on character and setting rather than shock and gore to chill audiences to the marrow.
And sometimes we are who we eat.
Remakes may get a lot of stick in Hollywood, as filmmakers can be accused of being somewhat lazy and uncreative in that regard.
An ambitious (if somewhat uneven) slice of downbeat American gothic which interweaves grim melancholia with pointed satire, doomy portent and moments of gnawing revulsion.
Some of the film is gruesome in the extreme but there is always lyricism and pathos alongside the bloodletting.
Mickle and co-writer Nick Damici give themselves plenty of time to tease out their themes and ladle on the tension.
Jim Mickle's savvy re-imagining of the 2010 Mexican art-house horror marks a quantum leap forward in maturity and style for the Stake Land director.
Who can resist a good cannibal movie?
A rare example of a remake that is as good as, if not better, than the original.
Even though this is an extremely well-made film, it's difficult to know who will enjoy it, as it's far too arty for horror genre fans and much too grisly for arthouse moviegoers.
This social-realist take on the cannibal sub-genre makes for a surprising lyrical and quietly profound piece of filmmaking.
Mickle prizes credible characterisation above everything else, and casts extremely good actors, who succeed in making the Parker clan feel both frail and somehow stuck out of time, like freak survivors from the 19th century.
An atmospheric cannibalism horror featuring an impressive performance by Julia Garner, but it's let down by a slow first act, weak dialogue and an unsuitable score.
Mickle has fashioned a melancholy American Gothic tale set deep among bleak, misty mountains.
