Even those familiar with the history will be impressed and moved to see these events as Mandela experienced them, before the Nobel Prize and universal adulation recast the past in a glow of inevitability.
Elba has long been better than the film roles he's been offered, a tradition that continues with his leading role here.
No matter how savvy the screenwriter, it's hard to adapt a 600-page autobiography to the silver screen.
This Justin Chadwick biopic offers no surprises in technique or script (by William Nicholson) but is nevertheless a notch above average.
A potent mix of uplift and corn.
It works... kind of. If you were new to the Nelson Mandela story and were looking for a neat summary of his upbringing, his struggles and his achievements, you'll find it here.
With a sturdy, magnetic central performance by Idris Elba as Mandela, the film dutifully charts his life-long struggle to end apartheid, his wooing of Winnie (portrayed by a generously cast Naomie Harris) and the 27 years he spent in prison.
The story of Nelson Mandela is a truly extraordinary one, and while Justin Chadwick's biopic never stoops to hagiography and always entertains, it sometimes feels like the weight of the narrative is too heavy for one movie.
In the wake of Mandela's recent passing, this well-intentioned adaptation of the great man's best-selling autobiography inevitably takes on a greater poignancy and stature.
By the time the stoic, aged activist faces off against the imperilled leaders of a crumbling Apartheid regime, Elba has assumed a gigantic persona and consumes every inch of the widescreen frame.
Runs through his life at warp speed and still takes two and half hours.
Is armed struggle or peaceful patience the better response to injustice? In a performance for the ages, Idris Elba's Mandela embodies both sides of the argument.
Elba's central performance is the movie's trump card, and one it employs with abandon, shuffling the other players far down in the deck.
[Idris Elba is brilliant, but] every time the film might have cut loose as a drama, it either holds back or we simply move on to another time.
Relentlessly respectful, yet lacking the intense emotional punch that would have made it great.
It is through Idris Elba's finely etched performance that the real thesis of the film comes to the fore: it is Nelson Mandela's universally relatable core humanity that defines his heroism.
