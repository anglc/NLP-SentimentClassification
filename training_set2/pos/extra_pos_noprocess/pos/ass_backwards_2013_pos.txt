As with any kind of episodic or sketch comedy, some gags land more effectively than others, although you'll likely find a line or a beat or an image that makes you laugh from start to finish.
Ass Backwards overcomes the obvious beats with clever, occasionally dark jokes that reveal the sharpness of its stars' writing.
Ass Backwards is a film that is all-at-once hilarious, intelligent, poignant and accessible.
Wilson and Raphael do not hold back in their performances, fully committing to their roles and making Chloe and Kate both lovable and laughable.
