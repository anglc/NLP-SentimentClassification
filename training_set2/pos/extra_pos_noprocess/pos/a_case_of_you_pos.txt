The actors are on their game, with Long digging deeper than he's usually asked to, and Wood showing more restraint than she often does.
"A Case of You" is perfectly enjoyable as far as indie rom coms go - just not particularly original.
A winning romantic comedy...
As contemporary romantic comedies go, it's by no means an embarrassment, ranging from politely bland at its worst to very nearly inspired at its best.
By keeping their goals modest the filmmakers have given us a pleasant-enough romantic comedy.
Long and Wood are delightful to watch and have great chemistry, and on the whole, the film is, despite my better judgement, quite enjoyable.
A sweet and rather familiar rom-com, A Case Of You is carried along thanks to engaging led performances from Justin Long and Evan Rachel Wood.
