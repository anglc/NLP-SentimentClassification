This British heist picture is familiar but energetic genre filmmaking, more interesting in its particulars than in its overall conception.
A British heist movie that's well deserving of an American audience.
To borrow from a term for the gritty, working-class British dramas that this film also nods to, it's a kitchen-sink caper.
Athale has a flair for guy-pal banter; here, the talk is funny and profane, silly and profound, often in the same breath.
We're decades past the Kitchen Sink school, this kitchen's sunk.
The end result is a slick, satisfying debut.
The sarcastic banter and male chemistry between Treadaway, an outstanding Iwan Rheon, Gerard Kearns and Matthew Lewis provide as much pleasure as the mechanics of the twisted revenge plot.
