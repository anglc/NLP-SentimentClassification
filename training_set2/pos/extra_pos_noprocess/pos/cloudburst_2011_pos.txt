It's a delight to see Olympia Dukakis and Brenda Fricker, superb talents and Oscar winners both, share almost every frame of Cloudburst.
An affectionate twist on a classic tale of lovers on the lam, sprinkled with renegade hints of Thelma & Louise, Cloudburst is a life- and heart-affirming journey.
The two actors...bring out the best in these two women in spite of the plot lapses and odd tonal shifts...you believe wholeheartedly that these two are deeply in love, and Dukakis and Fricker gift their characters with a real bond of intimacy.
A rough-edged Olympia Dukakis steals much of this comedy road movie about two ageing lesbians who go to Canada to get married. Enjoyable, but unremarkable.
In its peaceful moments, it's a gem, but the wild stabs at wacky comedy are usually groaners, a shame in a story that's so smart and savvy when it isn't showing off, being dense, or winding down to a painfully pat ending.
Features one of the funniest, bawdiest, most memorable scenes I've ever witnessed in a film. Despite the formulaic elements, it still feels like an original.
The feisty actresses clearly relish their vivid roles.
