Newlyweeds is a naturalistic portrait, with a few hallucinatory flourishes, of a very specific relationship in a very specific place.
Shaka King's low-budget debut feature is slim on plot but rich in attitude and on-the-ground detail of New York neighborhood life.
A smoky, jazzy, biting and heartfelt comedy about two young people, one love affair, American life, African-American life, Brooklyn and - oh, yeah - weed.
Newlyweeds is a movie of excellent riffs, understated timing, and memorable performances.
The movie at last finds its legs in a windup that has great compassion for these sweet, lost souls.
More a series of darkly comic vignettes than a conventional romance, King's exploration of chemically altered human chemistry is amusing if slight, and his two leads are appealingly solid, especially Cheatom.
Newlyweeds is a rare movie about stoners that treats pot addiction seriously, carving out a space of its own in a naturalistic middle ground between the familiar standards of surreal comedy and moralistic drama.
... a touching weed comedy-drama that finally captures just what it's like to put your lips to some sticky icky and breathe in a mental holiday no other experience can match.
It's a special movie. Odd, disjointed and not entirely coherent, but special.
It's difficult to deduce whether Newlyweeds is too loose, or merely designed to appear too loose...Yet the movie has a certain dark charm.
Going neither in the direction of Reefer Madness nor a Cheech and Chong movie, it's both funny and serious, and its depictions of pot-smoking could be read as either promotional or cautionary.
