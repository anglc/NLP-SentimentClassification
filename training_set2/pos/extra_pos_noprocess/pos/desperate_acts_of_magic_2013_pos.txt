Gold's conventional script is enlivened by engaging performances, authentic tricks and amusing noir-parody touches as it delves into the often unsavory institutional politics of the magic industry.
The story has a few convolutions too many, but a generous sprinkling of tricks and illusions will appeal to fans of magic.
Desperate Acts of Magic is a pleasant little film.
Does for the world of magic what "The Wrestler" did for another profession based on illusion. Much better than "The Prestige" even though with a more modest provenance.
Low-key, low-budget but highly likeable comedy about magicians in all their trickery.
What makes this film impressive is an unending parade of magic tricks performed by experts and filmed without editing tricks or special effects.
