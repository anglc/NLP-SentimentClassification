"The Quiet Ones" is rated PG-13, but it's scarier than R-rated gorefests, like "Proxy," "Nurse 3D," and "American Mary." Anyone can create disgust; creating slowly-building disquiet is entirely another proposition.
A retro possession story that will wind up being best remembered for its groovy '70s setting (lots of mutton-chop sideburns and T. Rex and Slade songs on the soundtrack) and a deliciously sinister performance from Jared Harris.
There is a lot to admire as the film embraces a pleasing brand of old-school chills over modern-day, pop-culture hipness.
Things certainly do go bump in the night--and the day and the morning and at just about every other possible moment that Pogue can toss in an amped-up sound effect to scare the pants off his hopefully susceptible viewers.
A very watchable horror film, psychological shocker, or whatever you want to call it.
We're here for the scares and chills, and on this front the film does enough in building atmosphere and providing the requisite frights to prove watchable.
The movie does have some nice takeaways, mostly to do with Harris' gleefully unhinged performance...but they are few and far between.
