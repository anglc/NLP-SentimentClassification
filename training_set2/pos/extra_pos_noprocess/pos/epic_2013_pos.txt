With its array of goofy sidekicks (Aziz Ansari as a slug almost runs away with the whole picture) and carefully crafted relationships, Epic certainly manages to tell a compelling tale.
It is a testament to how spoiled we have become by mainstream animated features that a film as visually arresting as Epic would be considered run-of-the-mill.
The story is pretty routine, but it's the vivid colors and sense of excitement that comes with the crisp animation that makes it really work.
The story has a nice combination of reconciliation, drama and humor. There are some very funny jokes and pratfalls in the film. The kids in the audience laughed at the jokes aimed at them, but this film works for adults too.
However closely you look, "Epic" is epically gorgeous in its art design and animation.
Boasts plenty of thrills, good humour and an empowering, tall and angular female protagonist - even if things sometimes feel a little rushed and aren't always in balance.
An absolute delight from start to finish, Epic features an award-worthy sequence where giant figures in extreme close-up move in slow motion as the tiny heroes scatter about. There's a freshness and originality to it that we see all-too-rarely.
Though the story may be slight, the film is stacked with brilliantly colourful characters, a fabulous voice cast and simply spectacular animation.
Sure there's not much original here ... but it's well done, and that can't always be expected. Like a dandelion thistle, Epic is light and fluffy and quickly lost in the breeze.
A fantasy forest is a fabulous setting for animation; it is filled with all shapes and sizes and colours of flowers and animals ... Sweet and funny and sometimes exciting, Epic is a cleverly made visual delight, certain to keep younger kids entertained
... has enough excitement and visual flair to appeal to moviegoers of any age.
Beautiful 3D animation coupled with a compelling story and fantastic writing make this the best animated movies since Rise of the Guardians.
Beautifully animated forest fantasy for undemanding families.
I remember, not so very long ago, when most of the protagonists in children's movies were male. The change in recent years has been, well, 'Epic.'
Extraordinary! A magical and wondrous - and blessedly original - animated movie experience for everyone.
Produces images of poetic power ... The catch is that the world the filmmakers create is far more interesting than the story they tell in it in it or the characters they put in it.
It's not quite an animated masterpiece, but it's still a fun, sweet-hearted kid-pleaser that boasts some downright lovely animation.
Apart from the visuals, it's pretty undistinguished.
