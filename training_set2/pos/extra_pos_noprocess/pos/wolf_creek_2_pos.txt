"Wolf Creek 2" is gory, disturbing, inventive, twisted and rather well made.
A fast-moving, lean killing machine that will delight genre fans.
As well made as it is, it would be great to see what McLean could do if he were free from genre conventions and could put his many talents to use in a movie not built around beheadings and dismemberments.
