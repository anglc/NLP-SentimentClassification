While no means a masterpiece, it's a Stephen King film worthy of viewing once or twice...
A scene-stealing performance by a menacing George C. Scott and a terrific musical score by Tangerine Dream elevate this entertaining companion piece to 1978's The Fury.
Stephen King didn't like it, but it really ain't that bad.
It's not great. It mainstreams all the novel's subversiveness, but it's watchable.
One of the better King book-to-film adaptations.
