While Jaws: The Revenge, Tentacles and Aquanoids are all worthy so-bad-they're-amusing schlockers, this tale of a giant prehistoric shark chowing down on the citizenry takes the piscatorial prize for laugh-out-loud inanity. Forget the dodgy CGI of Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus because you won't believe what the makers of this Israeli-South African co-production try to get away with, especially when their oversized mama megalodon swallows jetskiers and life-rafts of survivors whole. Torchwood star John Barrowman looks like he's having a great time, not least when he ad-libs "the line" at 66 minutes in.
