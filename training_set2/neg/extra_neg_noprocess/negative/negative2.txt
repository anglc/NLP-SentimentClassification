The execution is so bland it makes even the ludicrous stretches of the plot seem airless and unexciting . When we finally get to the disaster movie in reverse section of the film, any potential thrill is lost in swathes of boring exposition and in undistinguished special effects (where did the money go?). It feels as tethered and limp as a TV movie.
