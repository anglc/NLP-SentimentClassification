Faye Dunaway does Joan Crawford, with the volume (and eyebrows) turned up to 11. This outrageously campy biopic, based on the best-selling biography by Crawford's daughter Christina, is justifiably famous for its excesses, particularly the "No wire hangers!" scene. But it's also genuinely compelling, and Dunaway's performance is gripping and not a little terrifying.
