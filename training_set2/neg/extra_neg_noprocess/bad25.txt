What more besides the title do you need to know? How about that the spiders are actually from another dimension? How about that a goodly percentage of their victims are sleazy brain-dead rednecks? How about that the "hero" spider was created by draping a huge arachnid suit over a VW and driving it around while people inside the vehicle waved the beast's big "legs" for added "realism"? And on it goes. Great fun, even if it can't quite match the incredible poster.
