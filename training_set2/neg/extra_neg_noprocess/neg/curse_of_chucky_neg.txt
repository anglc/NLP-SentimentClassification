Despite the return of Brad Douriff as the voice of Chucky and writer-director Don Mancini, this installment lacks the humor or thrills of the films that went before.
There's nothing here to indicate that the current iteration of Chucky contains enough life to stalk though anything more than a string of middling direct-to-video sequels.
Curse can't shake its groggy DTV presentation, feeling like a cheap experiment to see if the faithful will follow the series now that theatrical demand has passed.
