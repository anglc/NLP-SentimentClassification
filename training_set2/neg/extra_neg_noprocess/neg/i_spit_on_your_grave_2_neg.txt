A dreary affair that will thrill undiscriminating fans of torture-porn horror and nobody else.
There are glimmers of thoughtfulness here in the initial characterization of Katie and in her long, slow recovery before she can exact her revenge, but they're ultimately snuffed out by this mound of toxic trash.
With I Spit on Your Grave 2, director Steven R. Monroe returns and reveals that everything he seemingly did right in his first remake must have been accidental, for this horrifically misguided sequel is everything you pray a movie like this would not be.
Welcome to the bottom of the barrel. Population: this movie.
a grim, god-awful experience
You can't create a franchise using the ideas that surround I Spit On Your Grave, and this unnecessary sequel proves exactly why.
it panders to the viewer's basest instincts without even once interrogating them, and presents revenge as something entirely unproblematic. And when it's all over, we, like [protagonist/victim] Katie, can just go home.
