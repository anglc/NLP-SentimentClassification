"Walk Away Renee" lets us observe a mother-son bond, but Mr. Caouette hasn't found a way to galvanize this incarnation of material for strangers.
Produced on a far more elaborate scale than "Tarnation,'' which Caouette assembled at a cost of $213.32 on his boyfriend's laptop computer. And that's mostly not a good thing.
Renee really does feel something like a remake of Tarnation, this time with more budget and less feeling.
Caouette certainly knows how to manipulate images and sound, painting on a vibrantly textured, semi-experimental canvas. But aside from visual stimulation set to some cool music, none of the fictional stuff adds much.
Caouette hasn't gone as deep this time, alternately recapping the events of Tarnation in segments that feel too long and taking his mother on a U-Haul road trip from Texas to New York, a journey that lacks variation.
