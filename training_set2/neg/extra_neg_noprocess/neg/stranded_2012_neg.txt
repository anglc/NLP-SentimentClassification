It's a scrappy, unpretentious movie, with nicely calibrated pacing, but there's no logic, little motivation and above all, no personalities.
It may be time for everyone to agree that if you've seen one trapped-in-space-with-an-alien-presence movie, you've seen them all.
Sometimes an earnest, easily forgettable B-movie is just what you're looking for. But rarely do you feel like spending 12 bucks to see it - especially when that appears also to be the film's entire budget.
"Stranded" stops at being merely seriously dull and trite, rather than tipping into train-wreck silliness.
Slater is supposed to be incredulous about the existence of the alien threat, but he mostly seems incredulous about the script.
Mr. Slater, the only real name on view, looks embarrassed to be slumming in something so cheesy. But I liked the simplicity of the narrative structure and the lack of extraneous background information you get among most movie flight crews.
[Blu-ray Review] "Stranded" is far from the worst of its kind, but this is still pretty uninspired moviemaking with nothing original or different to separate it from the pack.
If you're looking for a low budget, greatest hits collection of some of the best science fiction of all time then I'm sure you'll love Stranded. That is if the filmmakers could even do blatant mimicry correctly.
Rote, declamatory representations of paranoia, fear, delusion and counter-attack get cycled through in this movie, whose title just describes how viewers will feel in its 88-minute grasp.
When the opening action sequence ends, you expect the film to back up or at least circle around eventually and tell us who these people are, and it never does.
It's bad enough to have one film seemingly determined to sit down and nap between gore shots, but there's a promise made at the end of the feature that more time with this aimless material is near.
Alas, Stranded isn't a for-the-ages howler -- just a terminally stupid, monotonously unimaginative rehash of umpteen space-horror classics.
Stranded doesn't tell a story so much as just present a series of sequential events.
It may suggest an Alien incarnate, but once you get past its exterior, it's as empty as outer space.
