There's probably a brilliant documentary to be made at New York department store Bergdorf Goodman. No such luck
The overall feel is less of a cohesive documentary and more of a slapdash scrapbook of facts, historical information and name-dropping.
Even people who find fashion really, really interesting will be bludgeoned brain-dead by this fawning, attention-deficit infomercial of a documentary.
Once-upon-a-time tales about Elizabeth Taylor ordering 200 pairs of mink earmuffs, or Yoko Ono's Christmas Eve $400,000 furs-splurge, can't compensate for a lacklustre storyline about the famously intricate Chrimbo shop windows.
A maddeningly unquestioning look at a retail citadel.
I imagine that watching a movie about Bergdorf's is probably a little like shopping at Bergdorf's. It may feel good in the moment, but in the aftermath, you start to feel a little sick about the whole thing.
It's fun to take a glimpse into this rarified world, but it's also a little off-putting when one interviewee explaining Bergdorf's appeal frames it as the aspirational apex of the American Dream.
What's it like to try on clothes at one of the most expensive stores in the world? You won't find out in Matthew Miele's documentary.
It's a shame that more time isn't spent inside wandering around the establishment Miele is celebrating, as the pixie dust of elitism and fashionista fawning wears off in a hurry.
