Soon enough the worlds of Up Top and Down Below feel like distractions, CGI Potemkin villages.
A Romeo and Juliet story for the age of CGI overkill, Upside Down zigs where it should zag and dulls where it should dazzle.
Absent any emotional grounding, the film is a gorgeous, sterile construction, like a dream city unoccupied by humans.
It doesn't really develop its story, or its themes. It doesn't truly draw out its characters. It evokes no serious emotions. It has - in the end - no gravity.
"Upside Down" is such a gorgeous wreck that I could almost sense Terry Gilliam somewhere muttering, "Wait a minute, I should have been the one to screw up this idea."
An otherworldly framework in which the rules exist to separate the classes until Romeo & Juliet come along to break them with the gravity of romance. If only.
The problem is that the physics here are patently ridiculous, and there is likewise no viable chemistry between stars Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Dunst.
Upside Down is an interesting mess - coming across mostly as a visual disaster with big dreams and aspirations that never quite pan out.
A movie that will surely wow audiences with its awesome visuals but floor them with its terrible storytelling.
Dunst, a veteran of the famous upside-down Spider-Man kiss, may be used to this, but viewers of the fantasy romance Upside Down may have the dizzy feeling of blood rushing to their heads. What is going on here and, furthermore, why?
There is little consistency. As a creator, you cannot tell us one thing and have characters do another without consequence. Upside Down is plagued with those problems, at least in small ways. It is frustrating for the viewer.
What begins as a grand concept full of unusual possibilities quickly succumbs to a frustrating mixture of pretentiousness and torpor in this threadbare narrative that unfolds in perpetual pursuit of memorable images over narrative sense.
The eye-rolling script is heavy-handed and emotionally distant, sort of like its intergalactic setting.
Riddled with cliches and eye-rollers, Upside Down is more down than upside.
A stunning visual experience spoiled by a trainwreck of a screenplay...certainly something to see, but difficult to sit through.
Upside Down falls into that old trap of overwhelming us with spectacle before we spot the emptiness beneath.
Worth a look if only for the Caspar David Friedrich-inspired imagery and shots of Timothy Spall's teeth.
Writer-director Juan Solanas is a better photographer than writer or director.
