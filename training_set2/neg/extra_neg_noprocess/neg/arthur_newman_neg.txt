An offbeat, sometimes self-congratulatory road movie romance.
They embark on one of those maundering, life-lessony odysseys that filmmakers love but audiences rarely do.
One of those many indies that exist to give actors a chance to go slumming.
Well-acted but ultimately unmemorable ...
The film equivalent of a dysfunctional computer sloppily assembled from discarded parts of other machines.
The promise it begins with doesn't pay off. And while "Arthur Newman" is not a complete disaster, it does leave you wishing the romance and the ride had been a whole lot smoother.
Completely disposable ...
A film that fails to make the most of a good cast and a great premise.
A bland and baffling oddity ...
The stars play strangers on an odd road trip who are meant to be finding things out about each other: if you were put next to either of them on a plane, you would quickly regret your seating assignment.
Constantly screws up even its own mid-sized ambitions.
a far-fetched story, told in a rather unappealing way.
Despite some amusing lighthearted moments, the film stumbles when it attempts to be more profound.
Arthur Newman is overwhelmed with arty ambitions and a heavy-handed acting style. Ultimately, all the weight prevents the film from taking off and soaring.
Obviously the theme of "Arthur Newman" is the American dream of starting over, but Johnston's screenplay hits it so obviously that it loses its resonance.
Academy-award winner Colin Firth seems to be doing someone a favor by agreeing to play Walter Avery/Arthur Newman.
Ariola can't keep the proceedings moving forward, wallowing in the blue mood for far too long. It makes a decent movie with something to share about the exhaustion of defense mechanisms into a slog that leaves its actors high and dry.
This is a decidedly minor effort, directed by Dante Ariola with a bland, generic eye, missing the pathos of interesting drama and the charm of quality romantic cinema.
