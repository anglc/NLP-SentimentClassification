It's not an interpretation of actual history as much as it is a reduced revision of movie history.
The Butler is often impressively acted, beautifully shot and clearly designed to try to pick up a heartfelt award or two. But, as a film, it's too fragmented to carry its own weight on its shoulders and is over- burdened by a starry cast.
The Butler tells an obviously important and inspiring story, but the actual movie is laughable.
A more grandiose version of The Help, The Butler stands at the ready, eager to offer an after-dinner mint of simplified, sweetened history to make us--especially white Americans--feel good about how that whole racism thing turned out in the end.
That Gloria expresses her own pain and her own desires makes the film's most important point, that history is not a trot through dates and period details, presidents and incidents.
It's effectively Forrest Gump Goes To The White House, with all the patronising political reductionism that implies.
If only history were like this: epochs of simple-minded epic struggle, followed by happy-ever-after closures.
