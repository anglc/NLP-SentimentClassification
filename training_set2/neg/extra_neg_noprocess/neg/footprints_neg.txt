Ambitious if airlessly microcosmic.
The script's so incoherent and the acting so amateurish that it makes the worst old-time Hollywood B-flick seem like "Citizen Kane."
This often risible head-scratcher never cracks the surface of its muddled ambitions, largely wasting its iconic settings on a series of motley interactions, Tinseltown trivia and self-conscious philosophizing.
From its "once upon a time" beginning to the anticlimactic end, "Footprints" remains fatally lodged in La-La Land.
A disappointing feature directoiral debut, which amounts to no more than a tiresome, shallow tour of Hollywood Boulevard.
A Hollywood mystery tale that's in no hurry to reach its destination.
The barely coherent Footprints seems bent on erasing any nostalgia one might have for Hollywood's heyday.
It all leads to some rather obvious bits of dialogue and down the rabbit hole of a half-baked, borderline incoherent conclusion.
