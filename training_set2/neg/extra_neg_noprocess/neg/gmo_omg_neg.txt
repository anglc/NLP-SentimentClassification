Why anyone would think that home movies of the director and his kids belong in a social-issues doc is a truly WTF question.
Starting from a place of ignorance and never going much further, Seifert omits anything that might hurt his obvious anti-GMO thesis.
This is a David-vs.-Goliath movie, but David's aim is so spotty that Goliath has nothing to fear.
In this unsatisfying home movie meets documentary hybrid, filmmaker and father Jeremy Seifert seeks to convey the potential danger of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in our foods and the need for legislation requiring accurate labeling of such.
The real truth is that GMO OMG...is merely the latest in a long line of one-sided agitprop documentaries. Far from an impartial investigation...Seifert's work is a monotonous censure that, in the absence of conclusive data, exploits fear.
