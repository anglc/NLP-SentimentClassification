Danny Dyer is back on familiar 'ardman turf in this cement-headed vigilante thriller.
Dyerbolical.
I find it harder than ever to take Dyer's hackneyed hardman act seriously, which somewhat undercuts this low-budget Death Wish knock-off.
In which Danny Dyer proves he's a brilliant actor in a heartbreaking work of staggering genius. Just kidding.
Dyer has even less presence than usual.
Dear me.
A disposable thriller with no aspirations to reality or serious social commentary...
No 12 months at the cinema would be complete without something jaw-droppingly awful starring Danny Dyer.
Packed with cliches, there's nothing remotely original about this East London crime thriller, which seems to be based on other similar movies rather than an original story or characters.
