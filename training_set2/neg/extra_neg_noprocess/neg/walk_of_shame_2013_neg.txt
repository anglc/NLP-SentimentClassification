This isn't as hateful as, say, The Other Woman. The concept's a little higher and the humiliation more cosmic.
An unintended nightmare scenario for women in Hollywood, and the persistent humiliation required just to get noticed.
There's not much else we can praise about it, but at least "Walk of Shame" is perfectly titled.
A beautiful woman leaves a bar and goes home with James Marsden. And that is just about the only thing that makes sense in "Walk of Shame."
Not even the fleet comic footwork of Elizabeth Banks can save this vile, unfunny stab at screwball farce.
Though replete with plot holes and lapses in logic as wide and ugly as the L.A. Freeway, Walk of Shame doesn't have the moxie to go anywhere ludicrous or dangerous with its premise.
The opening-credit montage featuring real-life news bloopers is funnier than anything in the script.
Banks is one fierce talent more than able to carry a film all on her own, and here's hoping the next starring vehicle makes for a much smoother and consistent ride.
...Walk Of Shame is a movie that asks you to not judge its main character by the cover that is her skimpy and short banana yellow Marc Jacobs dress, but the insubstantial contents...are so deficient, you're not given any reason to care either way.
Raunchy one-night-stand comedy relies on stereotypes.
Despite Banks' swashbuckling performance, Walk of Shame is about as mediocre as they come.
If you don't think it's hilarious that a woman dressed for a night out would 'naturally' be mistaken for a prostitute, there is nothing here for you.
The dire new comedy Walk Of Shame offers itself as a gender-reversed After Hours[...] It's a clever conceit,[...] If only it weren't so desperately unfunny.
[Brill] gets a few enjoyable sequences out of the unlikely culture clashes and a couple of the supporting performances produce funny moments. But it's mostly Banks who keeps the film going ...
Walk of Shame is the sort of film that drops a bombshell into a crackhouse, and you kinda wish she never had to leave the crackhouse... When she leaves, the film just rushes from scenario to scenario to tell the same joke. Over and over.
