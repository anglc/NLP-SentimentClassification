I don't pretend to have a clue how to adapt William Faulkner's "As I Lay Dying" for the screen, but unlike James Franco, I, at least, didn't try.
It remains to be seen whether James Franco can live up to his outsized ambitions.
Like Franco's other directorial efforts, it ends up coming across as an academic art object, somewhere halfway between a graduate thesis and a video installation-interesting, but only in context.
The past may never be done with us, but Lord, do we wish Franco was done with our literary heritage.
As I Lay Dying tries to adapt the impossible, but unfortunately it is bested by Faulkner's weighty source material.
Franco may prove that he has a fresh visual eye, but the highly emotive story is oddly uninvolving.
Comes across - whether it's Franco's intention or not - as a grossly self-indulgent project that will alienate some of his fan base.
Franco doesn't answer the elemental question posed by any literary adaptation: Why does this movie exist?
James Franco's readiness in approaching famously abstract source material certainly doesn't translate well into his directorial formalism, or, more appropriately, lack of formalism.
Whilst undeniably pretty, As I Lay Dying never amounts to the kind of significance its source material, cast and portentous stylings would imply.
If this isn't a deliberate parody of furiously solemn, self-conscious artistic pretension, it's an accidental one.
