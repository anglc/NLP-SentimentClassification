It's all you can do not to laugh. Oh, go ahead. But be forewarned that there are many miles to go before we get to the end and it will feel like an eternity before any of it makes sense.
If movies need us to suspend disbelief, you have to supply your own clothes hangers for Getaway.
Getaway is pretty much a 90-minute car chase. That's it.
The only participant to emerge with its reputation intact--though not its paint job--is the Shelby Mustang muscle car, which also delivers the film's most nuanced and psychologically complex performance.
Getaway has some of the crass trappings of a charmingly crass, go-for-broke action pic like the delightful Crank. But it's too dumb - and far too cynical about what audiences want - to even know how to have fun with them.
If you want to enjoy 'Getaway' feeling like you might be a blue bottle that's about to go 'splat' on the windscreen, rev it up.
The story is just an excuse for 90 minutes of fast cars and crashes ... filmed in a grueling, dirty, too-fast edited fashion...
While the seemingly endless car chase has many literal gear changes, Getaway as a film is a monotone experience.
It's mildly diverting, and it clearly hopes you won't point out if not its inconsistencies, then areas where it could have tried harder.
Getaway feels like a project that was undercooked, needing snappier dialogue, better shot coverage in its action sequences, and especially a heavier dose of macho charisma.
If you like car crashes and bizarre casting pairings, have I got a movie for you! If you like good movies, yeah, not so much.
Little more than a 90-minute chase scene, this film is targeted directly at the Fast & Furious crowd, but it has only one expensive car to smash up instead of many dozen.
What might have been a guilty pleasure is anything but thanks to badly-staged action scenes and a script that resembles a tick-list of action-flick cliches.
CRASH. "Slow down!" CRASH. "Pull over!" "Do it. Now!" CRASH.
With its smashy-crashy aesthetic and endless scenes of hyperbolic car-nage, Getaway exhausts the viewer's patience long before the finishing line approaches.
It's watchable enough, but you wouldn't want to pay cinema prices for the pleasure.
One of the worst films of the year, by a country mile.
If you want to see a film make any kind of sense - or at least not to profit from attacking scores of others with a high-speed vehicle on the assumption you might save one person - then run for your life.
You watch the resultant, wholly bloodless carnage with brain in neutral and eyes glazing over, as you would a re-run of Police, Camera, Action! at two in the morning.
Undeniably silly and riddled with both gaping plot holes and unintentionally laughable moments ...
Little more than a series of repetitious chases that ploughs through the cliches like so many piled-up boxes, barrels, crates and Christmas trees. All that's missing is some blokes trying to cross the street with a plate glass window.
It's difficult to know quite what is harder to believe. The completely illusory and nonsensical nature of the absurd narrative Getaway or Ethan Hawke was able to make this in the same year he shone in Before Midnight!
A witless and unforgivably tame car wreck.
