The scariest thing about "Ghost Team One" is the horror-comedy's blatant racial minstrelsy.
Destined to be a streaming-video hit with truant frat boys everywhere.
Thanks to the shakiest of shaky-cams, you don't know whether to wince or lose your lunch.
It's spectacularly unoriginal.
Ghost Team One may be the scariest picture this Halloween season, demonstrating that material so blatantly offensive can still be acquired by a major studio, and released mostly without comment.
An unyielding exercise in extreme pain.
Kind of a cross between Paranormal Activity and American Pie.
