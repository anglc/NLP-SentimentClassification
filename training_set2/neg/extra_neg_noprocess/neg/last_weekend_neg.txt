This tepid indie comedy lacks a consistent tone; directors Tom Dolby and Tom Williams can't decide whether to satirize or sympathize with their wealthy, self-regarding characters.
A flat drama filmed at a house that's more interesting than most of the characters.
The characters flutter about, argue and flirt, but they are simply too bland and vacuous to make much of an impression.
All the possibilities of a richly drawn family squabble fade faster than the final days of summer.
Tone-deaf, tin-eared drama about largely unlikable people with lots of money and a lot of self-indulgent problems.
At least the scenery is lovely when it's not being blocked by these annoying humans.
Seemingly made for film festivals that you have never heard of and cable stations you don't recall ordering ...
The film's attempt at political commentary amounts to a half-baked treatise on good governance in the face of tyranny and socioeconomic exploitation.
It's like Arrested Development without the irony.
