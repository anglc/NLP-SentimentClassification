In a film plunked somewhat unfortunately between the inspirational and the ordinary, the impressively patient Mr. Conde voices public-service-announcement sentiments about being able to do as much as anyone else.
Conde knows that being in New York has given him the opportunity to make a life, but Govenar's slow pace doesn't quite do the story justice.
Underwhelming and undernourishing.
Despite its title, there's actually very little dancing, or rhythmic flair, in You Don't Need Feet to Dance.
