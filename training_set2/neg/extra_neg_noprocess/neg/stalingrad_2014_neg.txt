Too often does [Bondarchuk] goad his characters to brim over with righteous bloodlust-and, despite the occasional obligatory misgiving about the barbarism of war, goads the audience to lust right along with them.
If you thought Saving Private Ryan needed to be more like 300, then Stalingrad is the movie for you.
Overall, Stalingrad is a bizarre concoction, part Putin-era patriotic chest-thumping and part creaky war melodrama, all set in a superbly recreated ruined city.
Stalingrad is long and operatic, but its message is simple enough: War is hell, but hell, it makes for good cinema.
To wave a flag, sing a song and celebrate it as the uncomplicated and inevitable victory of good over evil is the sort of easy message only an old propagandist - or a president for life - could really cheer.
Stalingrad largely succeeds in sensory terms but doesn't fare so well in dramatic ones.
Fedor Bondarchuk's bloody battle epic celebrates the excesses of war cinema far more effectively than it does the heroism of his countrymen.
