The performances and plotting are so impoverished that the picture deserves to be called "The From Hunger Games," and then promptly forgotten.
Prurient nonsense, a film only a couple of notches up from the women-in-prison films that were popular years and years ago.
The lack of story and relentless suffering make "Raze" appealing for hard-core genre fans only.
The entertainment value of the violence trumps most of the larger meaning, and the film exploits its characters just as they do their prisoners.
The fights are visceral and gruesome without going too far, but by the sixth or seventh bout, the lack of variation becomes noticeable.
Raze ultimately becomes little more than a tiresome endurance test ... Still, much like a less accomplished The Raid, some viewers may respond to its bloody, take-no-prisoners style.
The film favors brutal violence over any sort of social commentary, making its half-hearted stab at female empowerment feel hollow.
The tease of 50 gorgeous women fighting to the death has a classic grindhouse appeal, but Raze is strictly a "be careful what you wish for" proposition.
