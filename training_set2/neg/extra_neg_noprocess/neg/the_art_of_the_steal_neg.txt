A derivative heist thriller-comedy that passes painlessly enough at a brisk 90 minutes, but ultimately feels as disposable as the numerous counterfeit paintings that exchange hands throughout.
An uneven, mildly amusing, and highly derivative flick featuring a wonderful, quirky cast as a crew of art thieves who run a complex scam on the art world, and on each other.
Director Jonathan Sobol clearly understands the first rule of a good grift: misdirection. He packs his middling caper flick with so many known faces, it's easy to miss all the other familiarities.
Snappy, clever, broadly comedic and too obvious for words, of which there are many.
It's as if Sobol walked a tight-rope over the falls, got distracted by the view and then crawled back to safety.
With one contrived plot twist too many the final act descends into a fug of farce stealing the film's early promise.
Occasionally charming, yet completely unoriginal, this is dumb fun, no more, no less.
An appealing cast almost make the difference to this film, a sloppy half-hearted caper that never seems to break sweat.
Unsuccessfully marries the slick-suited jargoning of Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy with the gloves-off double-dealing of Guy Ritchie's early oeuvre.
Sobol ... borrows widely and unfashionably from the Guy Ritchie stylebook: he's either missed the trend by ten years or pre-empted the revival by 20.
Kurt Russell and Matt Dillon are short-changed by a script with a clever denouement that comes at the expense of the rest of the action, which is so self-consciously cool and vacuous, it's practically freeze-dried.
In the end, alas, it's the viewer who will leave feeling conned.
There's only a moderate level of humor and suspense in this formulaic caper comedy that seems to borrow from a few genre predecessors.
There's more steal than art in 'The Art of the Steal,' a second-tier caper comedy-drama that pilfers its inspiration from such superior stories of crime and misdirection as 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Reservoir Dogs'...
There's an additional twist to the scheme, but it's fairly transparent to anyone who's seen more than a couple of con-man pictures. Indeed, the plot is so perfunctory and shrug-worthy that it seems to function primarily as an excuse to let the cast riff.
