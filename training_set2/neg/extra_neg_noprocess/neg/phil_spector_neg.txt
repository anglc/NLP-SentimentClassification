Even with a Mamet screenplay and actors like Mr. Pacino and Ms. Mirren there is not much anyone can do to make the audience care.
It's better than most films of its kind, even as it remains unsatisfying as historical re-creation, philosophical meditation or pure drama.
Pacino and Mirren's teamwork keeps Phil Spector watchable even when it's dousing itself in dramatic ethanol and lighting a match.
It's an insidious whitewash of a convicted killer and an infamous smear of his victim. It's a shame on all involved.
A frustrating film that leaves the questions -- pretty much all of them -- unanswered.
As we're treated to another nonsensical, repetitive soliloquy about the victimization of a violent millionaire, it's worth noting that the Wall of Sound required an echo chamber.
Both actors are great and Mamet's gift with dialogue remains intact but the plotting and choice of storytelling in Phil Spector makes for a final product that doesn't make enough of a statement or tell us much about its title subject.
As you can probably tell, I found the message behind Phil Spector pretty laughable. As drama, it's not particularly convincing either, even with Mamet's rat-a-tat-tat flair for dialogue mostly intact.
A stronger film could have inspired questions about the legal system, celebrity or the actual personalities involved in this case. The only question Phil Spector inspires is, "What's the point?"
Great moments fail to lead to a satisfying climax.
