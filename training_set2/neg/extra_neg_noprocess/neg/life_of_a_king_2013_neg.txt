Solid performances-especially from star Cuba Gooding Jr.-elevate the film slightly above the familiar trappings of its genre.
The furious energy with which Mr. Gooding stifles his own intensity becomes a fascinating subtext in what is otherwise a forgettable film.
Gooding gives a strong performance, but viewers might be better off seeking out the...documentary Brooklyn Castle, which focuses on the championship chess team at an inner-city New York middle school.
Even if the story is faithful to the way the events played out in real life - and the official description is that the picture is a "dramatic retelling" - Life of a King couldn't feel more formulaic.
Though ostensibly based on a true story, the film feels like it has been finessed, exaggerated, and beaten into formulaic fiction. It's a twisted parody of high school and mentoring whose achievements are entirely accidental.
Unquestionably well-meaning, this tale of an ex-con who teaches some inner-city teens about discipline through chess treads incredibly familiar emotional terrain.
Any potential flights of invention or creativity are subordinate to the plain and emphatic delivery of life lessons.
Life of a King is a bland, safe and simplistic re-telling of a fascinating educator and his work helping inner-city students, mired by formulaic plotting, slight character development and poor directorial choices.
