Compared with the tepid contretemps of "Summer in February," the soap-opera theatrics of "Downton Abbey" have the depth of Chekhov.
Cooper stomps around ineffectually, Stevens makes for a blandly tame suitor, and Browning is unable to ignite any chemistry with either. The scenery is stunning. But the swooning has all the heat of a midwinter's swim.
A ceaselessly bland take on the famed Lamorna artists' colony in Cornwall, circa 1911.
Blah Britpic offers scenery but little else.
A poor script and patchy performances drag down this Edwardian-era drama.
Real-life historical drama about a Bohemian artists' colony in Cornwall just before World War I ignores their work... to focus on a tediously tragic romantic triangle.
Regardless of its true-story credentials, Summer In February seems to have been cobbled together from the moldy spare parts of countless Masterpiece Theater PBS movies.
Gorgeous scenes along the Cornish coast are impressive, but the film lacks the dynamic chemistry between lovers that's so important in a romance-themed movie.
...Summer In February eventually settles into a dull routine much like the dissatisfied characters of the film, which will make for an easily dissatisfied audience.
In the end, it's a miserable movie about miserable people, and we're left to wonder why. But any further time spent considering this forgettable romance feels wasted.
It's sad when a movie that aspires to tell a sad, even tragic, story can't quite connect, and lies there inert on the screen instead of galvanizing or even stirring emotions the way it means to.
Lifetime movie with English accents.
A period excursion into unnecessary suffering, leaving a wide open opportunity for gloriously pained performances and a steady dispensing of anguish, but Summer in February just doesn't register as intended.
As sumptuous as it is immensely shallow, the film practically revels in its attention to lush English landscapes as a means to distract from its derivative storytelling.
It's not a particularly interesting or revealing story but there's plenty of plein-air painting and plein-air nudity ...
No sooner has Downton's Dan Stevens cast off Cousin Matthew's tweeds than he's back on screen as a stiff-upper-lipped toff. And if this wasn't typecasting enough, he's playing another thoroughly decent chap who is yearning after a flighty young woman.
We're supposed to be saddened that their world is ending and that the first World War, with its awful human toll, looms. Instead we're thinking where are the bloody Germans when you need them?
