By the time the intricate plot and not particularly satisfying payoff are revealed at the film's end, many viewers will feel like they were the ones left holding the bag.
A noirish kill fest stocked with offbeat characters, lots of gunplay, unlikely plot turns and a lavishly coiffed Robert De Niro.
Whatever you do, do not look inside the bag.
There's much sub-Coenesque violence, corpse disposal and skulduggery with the underhanded De Niro always maintaining the upper hand.
"The Bag Man" has more attitude than panache. Yes, we eventually get to see what's in the bag. But by the time its contents are revealed, you may no longer care.
Robert De Niro brandishes an epic white pompadour that looks like a prank on eternal producer Robert Evans.
With all of its time-wasting twists and gratuitous moments of sadistic silliness, it feels like a leftover Pulp Fiction wannabe from 20 years ago.
There was a time when the possibility of Robert De Niro and John Cusack appearing in the same film would hold great promise. Not anymore.
Another failed attempt to revive film noir
Even if this is your bag, you can do better.
Cusack and De Niro never quite embarrass themselves, but the material is clearly beneath their talents.
Grovic doesn't address his ideas and tactics with enough seriousness to justify sitting through such visceral affronts.
