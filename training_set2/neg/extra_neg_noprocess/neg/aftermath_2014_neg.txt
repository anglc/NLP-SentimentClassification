An often tedious but clammily atmospheric end-of-the-world thriller set in the wake of a nuclear holocaust.
This is the story, understand, of a group of people taking shelter in a basement following a nuclear holocaust. It's pretty clear right from the start that all or most of them will die. Good times.
There's very little that actually thrills in this well-constructed, if underwhelming film that works best as a how-to vid for nuclear war-minded DIYers.
It is clear there is only one realistic place that this film can be going.
There's a compelling idea at work here, as well as an admirable willingness to explore the darkest reaches of that idea. Those things are, however, continually undone by a misguided script and weak direction.
...in practical terms Aftermath is likely to disappoint viewers expecting a fun action movie with monsters.
Awash in exposition-heavy dialogue, punctuated by the occasional Wizard Of Oz reference, the film provides no meaningful background on its characters, and even less drama.
