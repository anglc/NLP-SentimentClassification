Whatever tension the pic manages to build ... is mostly undercut by the recurring appearance of the fish and by the generally overemphatic performances of the human cast ...
The whole film is a campy put-on, right? Apparently not.
A few things could have been improved upon, but it's at least ambitious and has an interesting twist.
The film is simply too sloppy and full of holes, many of which should have been easily noticed from the writing of the script through pre-production.
[Blu-ray Review] Well shot and technically competent. It's also a bit of an insult to the viewer's intelligence.
Feels as if it were made by an amateur on his second film...
Beautifully shot, but marked by a screenplay that mistakes and substitutes volume for well staked-out, compelling interpersonal disagreement.
There just isn't enough going on beneath Beneath.
Its stance toward every dipshit slasher and creature-horror flick that's come before it never feels less than casually hostile.
