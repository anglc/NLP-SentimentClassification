A roughly chronological jumble of archival footage, unconvincing period reenactments, gauzy voice-overs, and half-baked ideas that makes one yearn for the stolid dullness of a History Channel documentary.
There's no "there" there in "Teenage," a meandering mess of a documentary that has the feel of a bloated, inchoate term paper.
Arty yet superficial treatment of provocative subject matter...
Filmmaker Matt Wolf's Teenage tracks the origins of modern youth culture through the early 20th Century, to intriguing but inconclusive results
Granted, the film's title is taken from Savage's book, but for a documentary which concludes that the teenager is all about the future, it spends too much of its time covering WWII. "Teenage" is a niche historical document.
Has moments that are quite intriguing, but, like a teenager, it can't seem to decide what it wants to be when it grows up.
A stereotypical response to Teenage from today's attention span-deprived youth would be, "Ugh, whatever." They'd be right.
