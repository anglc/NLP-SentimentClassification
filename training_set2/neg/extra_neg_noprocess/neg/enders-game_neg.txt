Enough people attended Ender's Game last weekend to place it at the top of the box office. But could any of them have known how profoundly unspectacular an experience they were in for?
If you dislike child actors, you might derive a perverse satisfaction from seeing dozens of them look so unhappy to be onscreen.
Hard to comprehend and even harder to endure.
It is its book, put on the screen without any new thought whatsoever. A seventh grader could watch it and write a passable essay about it. I doubt they'd have much fun with it, though.
The battle scenes are spectacular but lifeless and hard to engage with. We're watching a cascade of computer-game imagery.
It was a bit like standing in a room where someone is playing a video game on a screen and you're not actually taking part in it but you have to watch interminably this game being played and it's just really a bit boring.
I thought this was a pretty witless affair.
