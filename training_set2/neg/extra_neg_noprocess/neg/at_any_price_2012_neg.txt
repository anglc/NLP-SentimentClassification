The disappointment and malaise of a modern farmer's life comes through, but almost as an afterthought. As Bahrani makes clear, it's worth a more focused film.
Bahrani fills the frame with weathered faces and "At Any Price" feels like it unfolds in something close to the real America. But he wants to give us larger-than-life drama, and his strengths are life-sized.
Bahrani seems less interested in getting at the heart of a man who has sold his soul than he is in showing how the hard facts of modern farming have literally and figuratively changed the landscape.
Written and played with a little more subtlety, Henry and his contradictions could have been fascinating; as it is, "At Any Price" keeps us at a distance, gazing at characters who never quite come to life.
Like the small farmers forced to kowtow to corporations, writer and director Ramin Bahrani chickens out. His melodramatic script reduces a global conflict to a Grain Belt "Glengarry Glen Ross."
It clumsily showcases an environmental issue -- in this case, the corporate strong-arm tactics used to promote GMOs -- through routine interpersonal drama.
At Any Price has an interesting story at its core, but it's bogged down by undeveloped characters and sideplots, as well as a poorly-written third act.
Bahrani is striving for something epic and tragic - Shakespeare among the soybeans - but too often the film settles for merely melodramatic.
Dennis Quaid gives a deep performance of a shallow farmer who's obsessed with success. But the script for this unfocused, distraction-saddled heartland drama needed more cultivation.
Dennis Quaid turns in a strong performance, but writer-director Ramin Bahrani's earnest but unfocused melodrama offers neither a compelling storyline nor a satisfying message.
With Bahrani's assured direction squaring off against his ragged script, this proves to be a mixed bag of a movie, maybe worth seeing for reduced admission but not necessarily at any price.
It cheats you with acres of unharvested ambitions.
while [Bahrani] did create a sociologic examination of an industry and culture that effects everyone, and educates the audiences, he didn't know how to end the story.
Maybe the writer-director found himself adrift in the corn fields.
