Casting Donnie Yen in a martial arts film and burying him in CGI is akin to casting Arnold Schwarzenegger in an action film and arming him with a Nerf gun.
But not even the most garbled Tsui Hark joint is as unintelligible as 14 Blades, a film that's lost in its own backyard.
An immensely gifted physical performer, Donnie Yen isn't strong enough an actor to suggest an authentic inner life to his character beyond a vague sense of stone-faced dissatisfaction.
Over the top, over saturated and overly melodramatic, this wuxia action adventure follows an outlawed swordsman in Ancient China who has to save the Emperor, fight off deadly assassins and restore his dignity.
