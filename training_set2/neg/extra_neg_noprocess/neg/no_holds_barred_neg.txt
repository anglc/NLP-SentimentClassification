For months now, Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro have been sitting in their dens and nervously clutching their Oscars. They knew that an unprecedented challenge was looming... the arrival of Hulk Hogan in his first starring role in a movie.
The film is utterly lacking in the campy quality of the World Wrestling Federation telecasts.
As cartoonish as its star.
Charmless, stupid and badly made, No Holds Barred makes Rocky look like Citizen Pain.
Racist, misogynist, dumb, sadistic, lazy and tiresome, the film is about a big bout between a huge heroic white guy and a huge villainous black guy.
Maybe we should mention that the gruesome violence in the movie was enough to make this adult wince.
The final showdown between Rip and Zeus is overlong and full of uninspired wrestling stunts. The camera crews of the World Wrestling Federation do a much better job.
While wrestling fans surely will queue up to see their boy win the day, No Holds Barred is just a sweaty headlock of a film, with dreary, gory scenes and a bunch of slope-headed hokum to propel it.
Some may find the cartoonish violence excessive; the champion Tough Guy can't be anyone but a good guy, but that doesn't stop him from doling out to his enemies a very painful punishment.
Barred is tremendously crude, unapologetically manipulative (Zeus finally breaks down Rip's reserve by crippling his kid brother), and aimed directly at easily entertained 13-year-old boys.
No Brains Involved
Try: No Holds Suck. Tiny Lister is awesome, but -- apart from The Scorpion King, The Princess Bride and The One and Only -- all movies involving 'wrestlers' are stupid.
Hogan is obviously trying for the Arnold Schwarzenegger musclebound movie crown, but Schwarzenegger need have no fears. In fact, on the acting front, even Chuck Norris needn't feel challenged.
