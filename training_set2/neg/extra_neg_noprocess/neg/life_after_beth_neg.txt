The movie is DOA from scene one and is never resuscitated.
Life After Beth starts feeling more conventional the wilder and darker it gets.
Once it's safely slotted in the overworked zom-com genre, there's no reason to keep watching.
Baena co-wrote "I Heart Huckabees" and while he has a sense of humor, the jokes here tend to be meager and tend to dribble on.
While Baena tries to offer a reworking of zombie mythology - easy-listening music makes them horny and they have a fascination with attics and smearing dirt on walls - the movie doesn't live up to the promise of its dark start.
Among many missteps is a total tonal identity crisis. Plaza has described Beth as a "zom-com-rom-dram." (N.B. This remark is more clever than anything in the movie it describes.)
Life After Beth is an irritatingly undeveloped project. A charming cast and a few moments of inspired lunacy make it passingly worthwhile for genre fans.
At least it strays from the well-worn romantic comedy formula, but this sketchy tale of suburban teenage obsession struggles to expand its one-joke premise.
Getting people in creepy makeup to gurn and shuffle and get shot isn't automatically scary plus hilarious.
A screenplay that frankly might have been cooked up by a couple of bored fifth-formers.
It seems to be fighting a battle against itself, and is visibly losing the closer it gets to its deflated climax.
The comedy inherent in a human/zombie love pairing doesn't get this tired and unambitious genre pastiche very far.
Life After Beth is one or two re-writes away from where it needs to be.
Just as the zombie genre refuses to die, this fitfully funny and well cast black comedy doesn't know when to stop either.
