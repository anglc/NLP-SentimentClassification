A Haunted House 2 is not a movie. It is a nervous breakdown.
Run in fright.
Marlon Wayans' parody sequel is as inept and puerile as its predecessor, but let no one say its screenwriter and star doesn't give it his all.
Calling this one an improvement is like saying that being kicked in the shin is better than being punched in the stomach. Either way, it hurts.
What a nightmare! "A Haunted House 2â€³ is the kind of film that gives lowbrow comedy a bad name. It's just like the original, screamingly stupid.
Unless you've seen every awful horror flick of the past five years, you won't even get the jokes. A comedic dead zone.
A Haunted House 2 will satisfy only the basest of humours, while simply repulsing (or offending) the rest of us.
A few observational gags deliver, but all the doll-humping and chicken-slaughtering will haunt you for days.
Repugnant
The [A Haunted House] movies are like a strange sort of exorcism: They chase the demons away by having Marlon Wayans scream for 90 minutes [...]
Marlon Wayans is killing his own potential, screaming his way into comedic oblivion.
Mostly, the movie is seriously dumb and just a little depressing.
Marlon Wayans on his own has taken his family name lower than ever before... even lower than White Chicks.
I almost laughed when Wayans pulled out a pair of nunchucks to stupidly battle a swarm of dark moths and nunchucked himself in the nuts.
The line between actual horror and lampooned horror tends to blur these days, and since this effort is neither funny nor scary, it won't help clarify.
About as contemptible as filmmaking gets.
A Haunted House 2 isn't the worst way to entertain a switched-off brain for an hour and a half, but it's nothing you haven't already seen.
A Haunted House 2 occasionally tries to be a legitimate horror movie, but just like the comedy, it doesn't really work. Basically, this means you'll be hit with extremely generic jump scares every now and then.
