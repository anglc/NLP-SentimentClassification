The resulting domestic tension is rife with darkly comedic and dramatic possibilities that were better exploited on the printed page, where King was able to more fully delineate his heroine's tortured thought process.
Much thinner than you would expect.
In his approach to bringing his own story to the screen, the author gave no consideration for actual performance or humor, valuing his language over all else.
... lacks consistent suspense and relies too often on genre cliches instead of the clever twists that such material usually commands.
Creepy but underwhelming tale of a truly killer marriage.
A Good Marriage comes off as curiously flat for a movie about a woman who sleeps next to a murderer every night.
Stephen King adapts one of his own stories to the screen, but the finished product misses one crucial element: his voice.
It's arguably the dullest King film yet, despite solid work by LaPaglia to save it and a decent set-up that goes absolutely nowhere.
Stephen King's voice can be heard in the third act of A Good Marriage, but by then you won't care enough to listen.
A dull, lifeless chiller that botches a rather brilliant premise. Where is Frank Darabont when King needs him?
The premise can't quite sustain a feature but Allen and LaPaglia are excellent.
A Lifetime melodrama posing as a big-screen thriller, "A Good Marriage" starts with the germ of a provocative premise, then proceeds to take it in a direction that betrays the audience's intelligence.
