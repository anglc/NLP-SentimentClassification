Jeremiah Chechick's The Right Kind of Wrong has more wrong than right and plays like an ode to testicle jokes.
[Director Jeremiah Chechik] imposes a stiff pace on the proceedings, toggling between broad physical comedy that aches for a laugh track and oddball moments of genuine whimsy.
There are even a few physical gags -- including one involving a slingshot, a hang glider and a precarious arrangement of pastries -- that may as well be lifted from another century.
Logic and authenticity are thrown out the window in this predictable romantic comedy.
Skeletally standard rom-com fare, but its incessant self-reflexive schematic boldly, and wrongfully, suggests it has bigger ideas to make about love and relationships.
As the film progresses, and it becomes more and more heavily focused on the inevitable romantic linking of the male and female leads (including some late-film plot machinations that could have been left out), it loses steam and starts to feel perfunctory.
"The Right Kind of Wrong" is the kind of comedy that asks an audience to find borderline-stalking behavior charming.
Teeming with mismanaged ideas, but Kwanten's blank slate approach crushes the picture's hope for lasting appeal.
The film is so in love with its unoriginal premise that it can't see the forest for the trees, treating reality like an occasionally relevant prop and stalking as a sweetly romantic gesture.
Mistakenly convinced that cuteness can compensate for a lack of basic believability, The Right Kind Of Wrong squanders its engaging leads and cheerful joviality with a plot of stupefying senselessness.
The pedigree of the filmmakers is impressive enough that you have to wonder just what went wrong with The Right Kind of Wrong.
The Right Kind of Wrong takes every familiar romantic comedy trope and places them into a blender, giving us a story that we already know the ending to, and a main character that we just can't connect with.
