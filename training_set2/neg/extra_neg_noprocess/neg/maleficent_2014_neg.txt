As for the screenplay, by Linda Woolverton, it treads carefully, and all too kindly, in the footsteps of "Wicked" ...
'Maleficent' is an admittedly great-looking, sometimes creepy.
As a cameo, Jolie's performance might have proven spectacular; but as a protagonist, she doesn't give us enough to hold onto. For all her efforts, she remains yet another special effect, however spectacular.
All would be forgiven if the film had more magical feeling.
At least Disney was smart enough to cast Jolie. She has a genuinely heroic presence. If only the movie were equal to it.
