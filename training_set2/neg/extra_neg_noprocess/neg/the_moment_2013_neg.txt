"The Moment" is a psychological thriller more muddled than the mind and the maze it is caught up in.
Watching the movie becomes a kind of parlor game: Is Lee capable of murder? Which moment is the moment?
You don't ever really know what's going on, but at least the heavy-handed music tells you what to feel.
The Moment is another in a long string of thrill-free psychological "thrillers" that fail from start to finish.
After you sit with [The Moment] for a while, you realize that it just doesn't get crazy right.
A risible film but not an evil one, The Moment is made all the more painful by its seemingly earnest intentions.
The film is a hybrid of a Lifetime movie focused on a "strong woman," a run-of-the-mill murder mystery, and a yogurt commercial from hell.
