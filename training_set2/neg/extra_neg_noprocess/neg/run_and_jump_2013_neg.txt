Rather too much is going on to be comfortably accommodated in one film.
Whether it's possible to go on loving somebody who's no longer himself is a momentous question that this movie largely ducks, ultimately providing an answer that seems imposed from without rather than arrived at organically.
The movie is too pleasant, too sweet and too tidily assembled given the central trauma.
