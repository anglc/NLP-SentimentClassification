In his comedies, Goldthwait always presents a very particular point of view, but in his foray into horror, he comes off as just another copycat.
Goldthwait's pacing is all wrong, taking far too long to get his film where it needs to be and creating zero tension along the way.
It's all well and good to want to say things using the world of a horror movie, but it's even better when you don't forget to try and be scary for 75% of the runtime.
By aping upon other like-minded pictures and never quite releasing himself from the shackles of humdrum convention, director Bobcat Goldthwait sells himself short.
