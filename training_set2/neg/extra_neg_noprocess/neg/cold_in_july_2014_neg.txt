Hall does his best to make sense of Dane, but the plot turns simply don't add up. Good work in a not-so-good movie.
Unpredictable, progressively violent, with a knockout performance by Hall.
If you want to recreate the experience of watching a movie on HBO at 12:50 a.m. in 1991, Jim Mickle's "Cold in July" is your movie.
Writers Mickle and Nick Damici have an annoying habit of killing the noir with comedic one-liners. Genre hopping is all well and good, provided the thread running between is unshakeable. Disappointing.
Individual sequences are brilliantly staged and shot but the film still has the feel of a formal exercise and the plot abounds in loose ends.
Slow-paced, uneven and shallow. The effort might have been admirable but the film is plainly forgettable.
It makes a strong start but is desperately uneven tonally, and unravels into a bizarre spaghetti-mess of dangling loose ends.
A film which speaks loudly and directly, but doesn't have much to say.
