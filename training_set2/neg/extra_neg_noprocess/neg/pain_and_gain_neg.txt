Pain & Gain weighs about 700 pounds when it ought to weigh 2.
In between scenes of the muscleheads torturing their victim, Bay indulges his taste for treating women as sluts and grisly brutality as a nifty excuse for a cheap laugh.
This crude and ugly entertainment is as crass as everything this depressingly successful filmmaker has done.
It's official. Michael Bay, director of the Transformers clobberfests, knows how to make movies about humans, too. The problem is, he thinks humans are robots.
It's hard to see how any of these experienced actors, none of whom are convincing, saw the funny side of this or the appeal of their characters.
Rather than take its true crime caper inspiration seriously, it pawns off its real-life players as dumb action figures and has little respect for the victims involved either.
Lugo and his confederates feitishized the human body, were steeped in misogyny, and had scant intelligence, emotional or otherwise. Their story is brought to the screen by Michael Bay.
A movie in which women are either pouting, flesh-baring sluts or morbidly obese figures of mockery with terrible personal hygiene, where rampant homophobia is deemed funny and laddish, and where crude racial stereotyping is acceptable.
[Bay] tries to be funny, and it turns out to be even more brutal, loathsome and crude than his previous efforts.
Michael Bay's muscle-bound satire is Bad Boys on 'roids. And that's not a good thing.
Forgive me while I weep in despair. Pain and Gain is awful beyond imagining.
