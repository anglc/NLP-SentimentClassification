Called upon to carry almost the entire movie by himself, Walker has a tough time mustering genuine emotion, although he does better in the few legitimately tense scenes.
Walker's working hard here, and he has to carry the entire show, but many of the interactions he has with the other characters are melodramatic, the dialogue often feels flimsy, and the script stretches to give him more problems to take on.
Even when the movie and some ill-advised lighter moments let him down, Walker holds his own.
From the evidence here, Walker's forte may have been not action but stillness-a knack for embodying ordinary Joes without any fussiness.
