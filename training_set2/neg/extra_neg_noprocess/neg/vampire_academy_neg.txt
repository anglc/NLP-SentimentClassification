This is a garbage heap of weak quips, delivered by an assortment of pretty boys and girls and amped up with some cheesy moments of animal cruelty.
Not only plays like the crassest possible mashup of "Harry Potter" and "Twilight" elements, but seems designed to make those franchises look like eternal monuments of world culture by comparison.
This attempt to capture the magic of the "Twilight" and "Harry Potter" franchises tries too hard to pack all the backstory and borrowings into one film.
[Mr. Waters] doesn't seem especially interested in the supernatural parts of "Vampire Academy," and he clearly didn't have the budget to make what little hocus-pocus there is magical.
Ultimately more "Meaningless" than "Mean Girls," "Vampire Academy" is a busy, overcomplicated empowerment fantasy with more hormones than brain cells.
The only thing that distinguishes this teen-magnet wannabe from its predecessors is how lazily it appears to have been slapped together.
The action is underwhelming and the plot muddled, taking so long to explain the saga's complex mythology that there's no time left to flesh out the characters. Which is a shame, as Deutch's heroine has a sassy spark.
Rarely have I felt such disconnect between material and the actors tasked with performing it as I did with Mark Waters' Vampire Academy.
I died a little bit inside.
Richelle Mead's sharp series of young-adult novels might have been better off being adapted for longform TV, rather than the big-screen blunting they cop here.
Joining the painful list of Goth-drenched Twilight franchise wannabes - Mortal Instruments, Beautiful Creatures, Dark Shadows - comes a half-baked, yappy stab at blending sexy Undead girls into a teen high school comedy..Even hardcore Goths will be bored.
I thought it was a complete mess. I thought the teenage dialogue was puerile and that was a shame because Daniel Waters wrote the screenplay for HEATHERS, which is one of the really nice films about school but that was a long time ago.
It is so silly, so convoluted in terms of plot, but so insouciant that it almost gets away with it. Almost.
Despite an all star team behind the camera this is probably the first occasion where the film is literally impossible to understand without reading the novel first.
The screenplay by Daniel Waters, the director's brother, is stuffed with puerile dialogue, all the more disappointing given that, back in 1988, he wrote one of the best school movies, Heathers.
Previous teen films from brothers Daniel and Mark Waters had a lot of bite, so it's sad their first collaboration is a toothless horror-adventure-comedy-romance motivated by The Weinstein Company's eagerness for a Harry Potter-meets-Twilight franchise.
It was almost touching to reach the end of Vampire Academy and find that it not only left itself open for a sequel, but seemed so certain of that eventuality that it set one up.
Vampire Academy occasionally plays as if it's on fast-forward, rushing from one moment to the next without providing much reason to care about what's happening[.]
I can't speak for Richelle Mead's novels, but I'm assuming they read like the instruction manuals for a role playing game: there are both too many, and not enough, rules.
It's not a complete disaster, but even the appearance of Gabriel Byrne, as Lissa's uncle Victor, fails to make much of a dent in the slapdash proceedings.
A fast-paced yet foolishly fanged fable...
When the dream sequence killing off the cast is better than everything afterward, you MIGHT have a script problem... This is why we can't have good vampire movies.
