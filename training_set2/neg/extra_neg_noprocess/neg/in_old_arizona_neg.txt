Uneven film with brilliant comedy relief by Edmund Lowe, and lots to interest fans of Raoul Walsh.
Warner Baxter, better known as the dying producer in 42nd Street, won Best Actor Oscar as the Cisco Kid in this primitivee Western, most of which takes place indoorse.
Lifeless.
If it appears that I'm being too hard on this film, one doesn't have to look very far to see far superior films, both sound and silent, released around the same time.
