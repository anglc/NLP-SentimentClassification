The problem with They Came Together is that what it settles on as the parody-able thing about romantic comedy is how generic it can feel.
Simply recreating what we know to be hackneyed and safe doesn't suddenly make it hilarious and surprising. There has to be a spin to it; there has to be some innovation.
At times laugh out loud-inducing, but ultimately feels more like a promising Saturday Night Live skit (the romcom couple?) than a standalone piece of entertainment.
It's essentially a 10-minute sketch stretched out to an 80-minute movie, which feels even longer.
Taking aim at the romantic comedy genre with mockery in one barrel and affection in the other, this scattershot spoof is very much hit and miss.
As artificially sweet as one of Molly's lollipops - and about as satisfying one too: They Came Together is a breezy romp through the rom-coms of yesteryear that might just leave you craving the real thing.
The trouble is, the film's relentless meta-quirkiness never builds: it just clatters on, repeating itself.
