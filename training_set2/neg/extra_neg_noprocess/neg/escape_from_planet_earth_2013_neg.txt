An animated film that goes lamely where many have gone before.
Just like its hero and his grounded starship, Escape From Planet Earth is, for much of the film, a decidedly earthbound adventure.
Colorful as the 3-D aliens-among-us comedy is to look at, though, Corddry is handed a role that's beige as can be, and so are his castmates.
A children's movie about space-traveling blue beings that has lots of high-flying escapades but fairly low aspirations.
One only has to think of Battlefield Earth and After Earth to realise that putting the name of our planet into a movie title isn't always a good idea. Happily, Escape From Planet Earth is a reasonable exception.
A painted-by-numbers 3D kid-flick enlivened mostly by Rob Corddry, who plays the fastidious, nerdy brother to Brendan Fraser's doomed Buzz Lightyear clone.
Escape from Planet Earth doesn't even try to make itself memorable. It's like a generic case of really uncomfortable indigestion that you'll forget about as soon it ends.
nothing more than a profit margin placeholder for those without the creativity or the caring to make something truly special.
Chalk this one up as a decent kiddie film which takes aim at adults, but misses the target.
Content to pitch most of its plot twists and gags squarely at kids.
[The aliens] find 7-11s hypnotically beautiful and learn to love Slurpees. There are several scenes involving Slurpees.
Escape from Planet Earth is a mildly entertaining examination of intergalactic sibling rivalry that will probably appeal to many younger kids, but not to the parents who have to sit through it with them.
The best thing I can say about Escape From Planet Earth is that I didn't end up hating it as much as I thought I was going to during the first half.
An amiable animated feature that should entertain the younger kids.
