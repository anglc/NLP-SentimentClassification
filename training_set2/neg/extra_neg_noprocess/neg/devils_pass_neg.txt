Since found-footage movies are purportedly shot by the characters, hiring a muscular action filmmaker like Renny Harlin seems like overkill.
The decision to assemble it as a found-footage thriller makes it feel like yet another Blair Witch knock-off. And the plot seems to run out of ideas before the end.
I'm not suggest Harlin deserves better than the tepid frights of Devil's Pass, but chasing a tired trend with minimal storytelling heft doesn't do him any favors.
Despite drawing influence from a fascinating real-life event, this sloppily directed, largely tension-free found footage film sticks too closely to genre formula.
Its grab at realism makes the artifice highly conspicuous.
Harlan's film -- written by Vikram Weet -- is a routine low-budget genre picture, with blandly attractive young actors overmatched by the freakiness lurking in the wilderness.
If you know nothing of this incident you'll be intrigued, as I was. But the explanation, which involves another curious tale from the 1940s that continues to fascinate conspiracy theorists, is difficult to swallow.
An hour of waiting for something to happen followed by 30 minutes of silliness.
As Renny Harlin's career progresses, it seems more and more that his early gems were merely happy accidents.
