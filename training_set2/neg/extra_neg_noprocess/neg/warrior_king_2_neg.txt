If you thought the higher profile might have prompted Jaa to up his game, prepare to be disappointed.
Again with the elephant?
It's a shame to see both actor and director play things so safe.
Cheese is just about the only thing The Protector 2 has going for it.
Do yourself a favor and stick with the original.
Completely ridiculous -- as well as agonizingly dumb.
Think about how bad the acting and plotting have to be in order to distill the impact of a Tony Jaa battle scene. If you know a little about Tony Jaa, that's kind of hard to imagine. I know. But trust me. Or don't.
The Tony Jaa vehicle The Protector 2 has some awesome fighting and feels - in a good way - that it has escaped from 1987. It's still not that great, but it sure is entertaining.
Action junkies may not mind the movie's weak script, direction and acting, but even they will complain about the generally poor fight sequences. Non-genre fans will let this one slide right by.
Tony Jaa is still an impressive fighter, and he's again surrounded himself with other equally impressive martial artists to duel, but the effort is squandered.
It's a maddening film, one that exploits [Tony] Jaa's abilities one moment then second guesses them the next.
A feature best suited for the fast-forward button, where viewers can race to the best parts without having to deal with what passes for suspense in this ridiculous follow-up.
The bigger The Protector 2 gets, the further it gets away from Jaa's basic appeals [...] Clearing a room flush with faceless bad guys is what Jaa does, but otherwise, less is more.
Suffers badly from comparison to THE RAID. The inept JAWS 3D style FX don't help. A back-to-basics approach would have been much better.
The Protector 2 is a sadly misguided action abomination filled with ugly visuals and confused characters, failing to showcase any genre competency in the least bit.
CGI Jaa? Say it ain't so.
