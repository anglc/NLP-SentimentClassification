Wish You Were Here is an excellent idea for a State Department video, to remind travelers the obvious things not to do when visiting an unfamiliar country. As a drama, it feels a little empty.
A dull drama about domestic squabbling that hopes to be mistaken for a thriller.
The time you spend trying to piece together a mystery that is presented as a teasing puzzle inevitably diverts you from deeper identification with characters who are not particularly sympathetic to begin with.
It's too easily satisfying, too traditionally well-made to be an honest portrait of dissatisfaction.
Whatever sentiments the title 'Wish You Were Here' evokes in you, flush them. Here is no lighthearted vacation comedy but, instead, a well-acted "psychological thriller" with few thrills but much angst.
Wish You Were Here is best enjoyed by fans of the actors involved or "strangers in a strange land" flicks; it'll be less satisfying to those looking for drama/mystery.
I found myself longing for it to reach its destination.
