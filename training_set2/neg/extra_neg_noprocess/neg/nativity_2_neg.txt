'Nativity 2' offers roughly as many laughs as the Queen's speech.
It might actually be funnier if you haven't seen the first film, but I'm not in a position to say--only that it's disappointingly similar to the original, and suffers from the comparison.
The only laughs come from the film's title and Jessica Hynes as a ridiculously pretentious TV hostess.
The earlier, fairly crummy picture now seems like FW Murnau's Sunrise when set beside the blitzkrieg of awfulness that is Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger!
Offers little in the way of festive fun.
The first Nativity was a corny, amateurish shambles, but it had that hard-to-define quality of likeability. Its sequel has none.
Overlong and idiotic it raises a few chuckles thanks to the game cast.
Silly, goofy and pretty groanworthy. But it is unpretentious and is, after all, aimed at very young children.
It hurts to remember.
Despite some decent songs and a supporting cast full of likeable scene-stealing moppets, this remains a dismal, poorly structured comedy sequel that's depressingly low on laughs.
Deliberately or otherwise, this sequel pushes the amateurish angle much harder, and seems to wear its abject lousiness as a badge of honour.
The kids have their moments, Tennant is game but Wootton's puppy-dog persona is just about ready to be put down.
Even this charming cast struggle to bring life to an overlong story that has all the sizzle of leftover turkey.
