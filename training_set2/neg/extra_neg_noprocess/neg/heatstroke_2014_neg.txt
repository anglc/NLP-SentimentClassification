A mediocre thriller with barely anything above middling basic stalk and chase fodder...
You wish Evelyn Purcell's action thriller just had a bit more character, and not a budget-cutting location that looked great in front of a camera.
Taking the bratty teen genre out of the sitcom and into the African wilds minus Africans, doesn't do either much good in this Euro-safari female action hero thriller. Touching on surviving a surly stepchild as much as assorted villains along the way.
While the characters can be irritating and problematic at times, they are not unrealistic.
The real act of survival is making it through Heatstroke all the way through to the end.
A cheeseball B-movie about a woman and a girl combating arms dealers in the African desert that fails to generate suspense, excitement, or even unintentional B-movie laughs.
Making the most of its shooting location, but little else, Heatstroke generates middling thrills with its underwritten, overfamiliar tale of survival.
