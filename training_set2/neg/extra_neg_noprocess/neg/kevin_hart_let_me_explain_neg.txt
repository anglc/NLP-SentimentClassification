Once Hart finally gets onstage his act can barely live up to the hype.
Any comic who can play the Garden must be good, but you wouldn't know it from this jumble of random routines and on-the-bus footage.
I'd rather attend a Norman Wisdom tribute concert in downtown Tirana than see this film again.
Hart's impressive physicality and the background special effects, which become their own running joke, are a smokescreen disguising how poorly written his rambling gags actually are.
I so wanted to be moved to genuine laughter, but it came in only fits and starts.
The Kevin Hart brand is clearly doing well, but Let Me Explain doesn't seem interested in providing anything more than a surface-level presentation of the product.
Hart nothing but a lightweight.
Kevin Hart works hard but is only funny with about 50% of his comedy routine.
On the whole, Hart's material veers toward the lowbrow and doesn't quite hit the heights of cleverness, talent, language, or delivery that predecessors like Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and Chris Rock reached.
Kevin Hart is indeed a talented comedian. This is just not his best material.
