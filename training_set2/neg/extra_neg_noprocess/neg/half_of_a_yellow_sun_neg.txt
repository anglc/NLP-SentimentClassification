Biyi Bandele has excerpted their story from a much wider-ranging narrative, but the action here is still so tightly compressed that this feels like a precis for a movie twice its length.
"Half of a Yellow Sun" winds up being one of those movies in which a pesky event of great historical import keeps getting in the way of a soap-opera romance.
"Half of a Yellow Sun" deals with human tragedy, but it never really makes a human connection.
The plot goes everywhere and nowhere, coming across as a disconnected series of events rather than a unified whole. Ejiofor and Newton offer solid but unexceptional performances, as though hampered by the director's lack of vision.
