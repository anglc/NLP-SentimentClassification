Frankly, the guy just isn't very interesting.
Groovy period soundtrack aside, "The Look of Love" has almost nothing to say of any interest, importance or humor.
Director Michael Winterbottom and screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh provide the essential outline of Raymond's story, but they're a little too preoccupied with its glitzy aspects.
A puzzlingly misconceived biopic: a tasteful, subdued movie about a man who was as tasteless and unsubdued as they come.
Coogan's own impersonation is precise, but the melancholy that finally engulfs Raymond is beyond him.
The Look of Love comes off as an extremely standard biopic that seems to have emerged directly from a template for such films...
Coogan is adept at playing the cad, but Winterbottom gives him little else to do.
Coogan never comes close to disappearing into the character, leaving the whole movie teetering uneasily between campy naughtiness and empathetic character study.
It's a case of "fourth time unlucky" for frequent collaborators Michael Winterbottom and Steve Coogan. Well, "uninspired" might be more accurate.
It's structured around the question, "What went wrong?" but we can guess the answer about five minutes into the film.
Maybe there was a time when just boobs and money were sufficient to entertain. Not anymore.
The Look of Love is the latest and -- I'm sorry to report -- the least of Coogan and Winterbottom's team-ups.
