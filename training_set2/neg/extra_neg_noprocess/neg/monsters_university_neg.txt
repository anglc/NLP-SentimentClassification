This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets.
With its juvenile orientation, uninspired gags, and disappointing lack of pathos, it's a close cousin to A Bug's Life, and certain to be just as forgotten.

There's a rather tired, willed atmosphere hanging over it.
