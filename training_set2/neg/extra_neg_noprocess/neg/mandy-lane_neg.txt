Levine has fun with the genre, but he's found more interesting movies to make since. "Mandy" isn't quite dandy, but it's a cut above average.
While some of the kills are sufficiently clever and gnarly, "Mandy Lane" is never particularly frightening. And the twist at the end raises the wee issue of character motivation-or lack thereof.
A slightly artsy attempt to revive the teen slasher movie, "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane" drifts awkwardly between popcorn entertainment and angsty mood piece.
The film's ambitions are respectable, but it unfortunately doesn't live up to them.
The third act twist is what's made this one's inflated reputation, but it's what makes this more risible than a mere genre entry.
A stylish and self-conscious teen body-count horror film.
The boys might love the title character, but it's doubtful many of them will like her movie.
Better never than late.
