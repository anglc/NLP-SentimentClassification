Slick and ambitious but also soapy and unfulfilling.
Neither proper science fiction nor serious romantic drama, A Thousand Kisses Deep is, in the end, too stupid to be worthwhile.
After a mildly intriguing first 20 minutes, most viewers will want to take an hour-length jump into the future to put this idiotic film behind them.
Only see this if you have a time machine which allows you to go back and regain the 84 minutes you spent watching it.
A vaguely ambitious but finally wretched exploration of alternative poverty-row realities.
The script's understanding of psychoanalysis seldom rises above the Wikipedian and David Warner's cryptic Freudian janitor rather put me in mind of the mystical Jacuzzi repairman played by Chevy Chase in Hot Tub Time Machine.
Nicely glossed melodrama that lacks the poetic depths of its musical namesake.
The initially-promising story about a haunted woman who travels back in time to reveal the truth is as unconvincing as they come.
Lustig strains for poetic meaning but comes up empty-handed. Unless, that is, you happen to like cod-Freudian naval-gazing.
A Thousand Kisses Deep certainly has ambitions, but the film struggles to lives up to the Leonard Cohen poem it's named after.
It's brimming with bold ideas but none entirely come off, despite a willing cast and solid performances from the leads.
