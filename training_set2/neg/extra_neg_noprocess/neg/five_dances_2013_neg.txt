There's an interesting vibe there, but it's not enough to save what seems like a failed experiment.
Though the film's untested cast struggles with the drama, and the sketched-out story is often banal (there are several amateurish calls-to-mom scenes), the presentation of a specific city subculture is etched from the heart.
Unfortunately, schmaltzy music and drab melodrama drag down the otherwise graceful moves of Five Dances.
At times the plot seems to exist merely to string together all these dance scenes ... Unfortunately, Five Dances feels more interested in the art than the artist.
Anyone not associated with the world of modern dance and/or anyone not fixated on the bodies of agile young men will find little of interest in this slow, claustrophobic film
