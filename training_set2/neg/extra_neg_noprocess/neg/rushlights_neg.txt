Polished but unmemorable.
Maybe noir just feels a bit old at this point. No matter what, the movie isn't worth the Texas heat.
They say it isn't nice to kick a dog when it's down. But man, there are a lot of dogs in "Rushlights"...
There are too many twists in Antoni Stutz's uninvolving "Rushlights."
It all dwindles into "Who cares" long before the end of the road.
Whatever pleasure could be derived from the movie's generically twisty plotting is negated by cardboard characterization, indifferent editing rhythms, and a score that sounds like it was pulled from a production music library.
Drifts glumly from one ludicrous narrative development to the next.
A genre exercise that shows some promise, but descends from pleasant obfuscation into patent absurdity.
In this film about murder, the last 10 minutes are enough to kill me.
Somehow the story can't quite tally with the rather familiar storyline.
A lackluster neo-noir thriller set deep in the dark heart of Texas, Rushlights delivers plot twists galore. If only the protagonists, a pair of hard-luck L.A. teens, were interesting enough to make audiences care what becomes of them.
It's a lousy ending stapled to an underwhelming picture, leaving Rushlights more of a bungled card trick than a steamy, scary ride of intimidation.
