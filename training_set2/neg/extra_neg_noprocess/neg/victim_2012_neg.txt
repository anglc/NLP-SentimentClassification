This is solidly made, but once you get past the attempts at realism - the banter, the backstories, the music, the clothes - it's a desperately corny yarn.
The set-ups are familiar, the characters well worn and the film-makers' message (we are all victims) writ cornily large. But co-writer Chin is an imposing screen presence of whom we may expect more in future.
Preachy and cliched, Victim has some merit in the bantering dialogue and fresh, appealing performances but all the good intentions don't necessarily add up to a good film.
A few solid observations aside, this is the urban thriller running on low-fi autopilot.
Both script and cast deserved better.
