Despite the campus setting, little about the story is intelligently designed.
Even by the rather lax standards of the Christian film industry, God's Not Dead is a disaster.
The Almighty deserves better advocacy than he gets in this typically ham-fisted Christian campus melodrama.
Lambasts reason, and celebrates Christianity unabashedly, which is a shame, because it has an opportunity to really challenge its target audience.
Continually, I bemoan the fact that viewers of faith - and I'm among them - are under-served when it comes to high-quality faith-based films.
Ban this sick filth.
A sloppily written, badly argued, unevenly acted film about a first-year college student who tries to prove the existence of God within weeks of setting foot on campus.
The prostelytizing concept immediately loses credibility because no teacher at a legitimate academic institution would make that demand, augmenting it with threat of failure.
Teen-friendly, faith-based movie is heavy on dogma.
Dubious religious content aside, God's Not Dead is, above all, a dismal piece of filmmaking.
Any just God would likely recoil from the ham-fisted and spurious defense put forth in this film.
It's not just bad filmmaking; it's bad Christianity.
God may not be dead, but I'd be willing to wager this movie at least gave him a faint wave of nausea.
While it most certainly has some very good qualities, it is ultimately undone - at least for general audiences - by a completely unsubtle desire to do more than simply tell a meaningful story; it wants to rock the world.
The angriest faith-based film in recent memory
