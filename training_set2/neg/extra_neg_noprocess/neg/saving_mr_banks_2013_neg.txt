The whole thing leaves you with an appalling chill. It feels like a warning from Hollywood to the ambivalent creators of anything: Take the spoonful of sugar or we'll force-feed it to you.
Saving Mr Banks is a merciless film. It hits you with every sentimental low blow it can think of. Then it pounds you again. And when you're down, it jumps on you.
"Saving Mr. Banks" is a shameless wad of corporate PR, a feel-good, self-serving Disney film about the making of a Disney film.
Emma Thompson's character comes off as the stodgy Fun Police, rather than an author trying to protect her work.
Genial, inconsequential, deeply odd but not quite "quirky."
This is Disney wielding its cultural influence as an emotional cattle prod.
