There is little to this film that isn't very obvious and sometimes even oblivious.
A Girl and a Gun seems designed to encourage the growing number of American ladies packing heat, but it's practically reverse propaganda...
Catheryne Czubek's documentary is itself like a shotgun, as its scatter-shot thematic blast is wide and lacking in precision.
