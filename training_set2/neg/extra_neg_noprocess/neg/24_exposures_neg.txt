24 Exposures comes across like a clever idea that never got past the concept stage. It might have been fun for him to make, but it's definitely a chore to sit through.
Some half-baked ideas about representation versus reality emerge in the lax improvised dialogue.
The movie ultimately becomes a queasy bromance, the foundation of which is less than flattering.
Unfortunately, this would-be erotic thriller is just too unfocused and slapdash to satisfy its promise.
Improvised dialogue can work wonderfully if the actors have a solid feel for their characters, but everyone here seems rushed and uncomfortable.
Like its influences, works better as a familiar turn-on than a riveting cop drama that happens to be steamy.
24 Exposures has a handful of interesting ideas-and a lot of cute topless girls-but it doesn't add up to much.
There's enough that's done well in 24 Exposures that makes me wish Swanberg had gone the polished route with better actors and a larger crew.
Is Swanberg pre-empting complaints about his methods by making a film about an artist who is, if not a killer, then at least creepy and unreflective? Maybe, maybe not. But the question will only interest people who follow Swanberg's career.
24 Exposures is an erotic romp without much substance to offer, completely lacking filmmaker Joe Swanberg's typically charming character dynamics and winning indie craftsmanship.
