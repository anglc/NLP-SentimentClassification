[A] shapeless, uncritical documentary.
Marcus makes little effort to illuminate Breitbart's character or motivation, so this high-pitched portrait ends up a little flat.
Lacking the objectivity or contextual analysis to more fully examine the important issues it raises, it's a minor chapter in an unfinished story.
This is less a documentary than a wholly uncritical celebration ...
Overall, Hating Breitbart is conspicuously parsimonious when it comes to providing biographical info about its subject.
Docu one-sidedly reveres late right-wing media provocateur.
You have to give Hating Breitbard credit. No other film on the subject would be as slavishly non-objective as this one.
... as far as this film is concerned Andrew Breitbart was a great American, a nearly mythical figure like Daniel Boone. (Who, as members of my generation will remember, also "fought for America, to make all Americans free.")
Perhaps because of its subject's unexpected death, "Hating Breitbart" leaves you wondering how far Breitbart could have taken his crusade for new media to topple the old and take back the power of storytelling.
