"Cold Comes the Night" provides Eve with an opportunity to showcase yet another side of her talent.
A bland and preposterous thriller in which Alice Eve and Bryan Cranston play unlikely partners in crime.
It's hard not to be impatient with a movie as openly lazy as "Cold Comes the Night," which is redeemed only by its performances.
Cranston, in a fake beard and dark glasses, seems to be enjoying his goofy act. Trouble is, this isn't the kind of movie in which goofy earns goodwill.
The plot and characters all appear to be consequences of a group of writers that just didn't have a single iota of originality among the three of them, and as a result, it's simply not worth your time.
Cranston's accent is Dick-Van-Dyke-in-Mary-Poppins-bad.
The film will leave you positively chilly ... and wishing Eve's talents had been suited by a better movie.
Viewers who aren't desperate to see Bryan Cranston play an offshoot of Walter White would do well to instead seek out past noirs that have made more out of this premise.
Might have been at least a little diverting had even an ounce of ingenuity been applied.
Perfectly serviceable B-movie noir.
You want to root for this little movie because it works so hard. But, finally, to not nearly enough effect.
