The movie is too calculated to shock. Korine just wants to be the danger he's warning us about.
Once a year, St. Petersburg is awash with thoughtless, unpleasant people making poor decisions. This spring, Korine is one of them.
...a thoroughly detestable piece of gutter trash masquerading as some kind of abstract piece of pop art.
I couldn't get past the feeling that this was basically the director's softcore material masquerading as a feature film
A ridiculous, repetitive and empty drama.
If you can look beyond Harmony Korine's misogynistic, uncomfortably leering view of the women in his film, there is some stuff to enjoy, though the film is held back by an unfortunate lack of substance.
