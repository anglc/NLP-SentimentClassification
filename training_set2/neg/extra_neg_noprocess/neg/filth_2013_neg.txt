I'm not sure I can recommend the movie, but this actor and this performance are something to behold.
Viewers hungry for a catch-all dose of Welshian sardonicism would be better served checking out Trainspotting. Better soundtrack, for one.
After a certain point, watching it is like listening to the ravings of an increasingly incoherent and abusive drunk.
Crude comedy.
Filth ends up leaving you with a bad taste in your mouth, not because of the content (you get what you would expect with such a title), but because it ends up getting nowhere with its shallow attempts at a plot and overanxious attempts to be bizarre.
It's called "Filth." Who says there's no truth in advertising?
Here is a relentlessly shallow and nihilistic movie, a 97-minute exercise in cynicism with nothing of substance standing in a manic foreground.
The film gets so worked up trying to shock you, to put James McAvoy and his accomplished co-stars through the nasty paces, that it lands with a thud.
To its detriment, Filth too often pulls its punches, and if you're striving for pitch black, that is most definitely a cardinal sin.
The hodgepodge of genre elements, loose narrative threads and ungainly tonal shifts keep the audience at a distance, a point from which everything appears increasingly bizarre and meaningless.
ultimately a forgettable film
There's nothing much here for those outside the PG Disney Princess-aimed target market to sink their horns into.
"Filth" demonstrates that contemporary filmmakers would do well to fine new ways of getting their hands dirty.
