There is much here to admire, but the overall impression is of a film that does not have the courage of its convictions.
Once they go into the woods, the movie becomes as interesting as watching kids hang around and play with sticks.
A sweet yet fleeting trifle.
Mashes a heightened sense of the absurd rather awkwardly up against arty pastoral, and the mock-seriousness of the endeavor comes across as unpleasantly snide.
Like lazy summer days, it will be forgotten almost as soon as it's over.
Like a summer fling, forgotten as soon as you re-enter the real world.
