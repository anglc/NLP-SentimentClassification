Moyer plays scenes as if he'd rolled out of bed at noon after a long night of shooting in Bon Temps and had his script pages shoved into his hands five minutes before the director called "Action."
You don't really care who done it, you just want it to be over with.
Neither suspenseful nor even comprehensible, John Swetnam's dashed-off script (carelessly directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi) throws up plenty of red herrings - and a stupendously idiotic ending - but not a single character worth caring about.
[Evidence] tries to camouflage a standard serial-killer story with digital flimflam and intellectual pretensions.
The always beguiling Radha Mitchell can't save this stunted procedural-horror combo.
There have been a lot of shoddy found-footage flicks over the past few years, but maybe none quite so shoddy as this.
There are interesting ideas here, sadly let down by a weak central plot and formulaic realisation.

Familiar, predictable, unoriginal... but not entirely unwatchable.
The story's strained, reaching plot goes so far off the CommonSense-o-Meter that there's more than enough "evidence" to convict this movie of impersonating a good mystery.
[A] combination of chaotic phony found footage and whimpering models.
