Jenison's compulsiveness and ingeniousness are interesting, and his research may prove to have some art-scholarship value, but another impresson is that spending 180 days to reproduce 'The Music Lesson' is a colossal waste of time.
Jenison projects humility, but he can barely hide his need to be perceived as the smartest kid in the room. In the end, the film leans harder towards vanity project than earth-shattering documentary
One can't help but lament that Jenison is missing the heart of the art -- he SEES but he doesn't FEEL.
Despite the exhausting quest taken up by the documentary's hero, the film doesn't register as inspirational.
The documentary, like the project itself, is an indulgent vanity project: friends making a film about a friend.
