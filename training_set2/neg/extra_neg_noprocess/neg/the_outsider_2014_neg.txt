Just know, then, that when the big caper finally arrives, you will neither grasp nor care about what's going on.
"The Outsider" is a subpar version of "The Limey" starring a subpar version of Terence Stamp.
Given a lot of style, this could have been another "The Limey"; given even a bit more humor and flashier action sequences, it might have passed for another Statham picture.
There's not enough here for even an imported action hero to work with.
Fairbrass moves stiffly through both the drama and fight scenes - as if he were underwater. Supporting parts in Jason Statham movies may be his calling, instead.
Blunt and simplistic, there's not a moment in this thriller that feels inspired by anything other than criminal TV shows.
Embraces its disposable B-movie leanings, but remains mediocre even under these modest prospects.
...The Outsider resembles the types of amateur movies we'll be watching in the future-shoddy simulations of genres we like, with either us or a similarly charisma-less family member edited into a film as the lead alongside professional actors.
This isn't Taken, unless that's how you feel after forking over $10 bucks to see this thing.
Sadly, [a certain] baseline competence elevates The Outsider, just barely, into the realm of perfect forgetability.
