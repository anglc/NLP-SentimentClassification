Kang's Na Young and Tee's Jason have a winning rapport when the script isn't pushing them into contrived shtick.

Loud, frenetic action drowns out the charms of Christine Yoo's debut film.
Yoo finds room for all of the obligatory bad first dates and fantasy sequences, montages and misunderstandings, a wisecracking best friend and overbearing parents. It doesn't appear that she means any of this ironically, or as parody.
The genre elements of the romantic comedy "Wedding Palace" attempt a transpacific transit, but get lost in translation.
Writer-director Christina Yoo has fashioned a film that can only be described as somewhat bizarre in its mash-up of American and Korean rom-com tropes.
