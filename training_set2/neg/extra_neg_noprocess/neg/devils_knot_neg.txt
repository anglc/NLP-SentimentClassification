Takes a long time to tell us nothing we didn't know ... A missed opportunity.
Comes across as a cinematic, slightly dramatized Cliffs Notes edition a story that's been told often.
It's not a bad film, exactly, but it's a jumbled, uncertain one, and it never quite makes a compelling case for itself.
A rather dull docudrama that doesn't have a strong reason to exist, outside of perhaps a financial one.
An exhaustively researched - and, quite frankly, very exhausting - adaptation of journalist Mara Leveritt's book.
The grief, the madness of the community, the plain stupidity of the cops, the mass protests that followed the convictions, the horrible power of it all - none of it comes across in this drab film.
If anything positive can be gained from Devil's Knot, it's that hopefully it will lead new viewers to the magnificent experiences that await them by watching the superior Paradise Lost trilogy and the conclusive West of Memphis
It doesn't quite gel as either a proper whodunnit, an insight into a killer's mind, a debate about lyrics in heavy metal music or a gripping legal case.
This blandly made dramastisation by Atom Egoyan is an extremely average courtroom piece that, despite strong work by Reece Witherspoon and Colin Firth, feels like a 1970s telemovie.
It compares most unfavourably with the recent Prisoners, which told an entirely fictional story about missing children with far more intrigue, suspense and cinematic skill than Egoyan's muted effort.
It's a pity to see [director Atom] Egoyan fumbling around here, unable to create anything great with the material - be it mood, drama or social critique. It's far from his best work.
With a rather stilted and unfocused aesthetic, this tale of bias and bungling covers the same sad ground that documentary WEST OF MEMPHIS did so very well. Reese Witherspoon works hard but she and Colin Firth are wasted.
In literary adaptations such as Felicia's Journey and The Sweet Hereafter, Egoyan has shown that he can depict darkness and explore loss. But here, he feels mired in stereotypes, or dependent on images that documentaries have already created.
Given all the revelations and developments in the case during the past 20 years, this treatment seems shallow and trivial.
Egoyan listlessly retraces the trial's tragic course but uncovers nothing new about human nature in the belaboured process.
Haunting artistry aside, it's hard to see what Egoyan brings to the table that hasn't already been covered in print (Mara Leveritt's book provides source material), on screen and elsewhere in the media.
This is a courtroom drama in which the man fighting the good fight has to wait outside.
Dramatisation or reconstruction? Devil's Knot fails on both fronts given its inadequate and dissonant treatment of real events...
It is a strangely unsatisfactory affair that doesn't quite work either as a documentary-style reconstruction, a brooding thriller or a courtroom drama.
