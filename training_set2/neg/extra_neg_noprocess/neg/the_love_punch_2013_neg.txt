This "Punch" never truly connects.
Thompson is one of those rarities who shines in just about anything. Her crack timing enlivens even her worst lines.
Alas, there are no sparks. There is no excitement. Hopkins' clumsy script simply bumbles its way past plot holes into predictabilities.
Most everything about this movie is predictable within the first few minutes ...
Hopkins managed a genuine delight a few years ago with "Last Chance Harvey," starring Thompson and Dustin Hoffman as two late-in-life lovers in London. But his new script has none of that wit.
The lead actors outshine a predictable script in this globetrotting romantic caper.
...an underwhelming and forgettable endeavor that squanders the efforts of its charismatic leads.
Pierce Brosnan and Emma Thompson...make a charming couple. But their best efforts can't save Joel Hopkins' weak script,...which he also directed, clumsily.
...appallingly implausible...lowlighted by a total lack of chemistry between Thompson and Brosnan.
Despite Brosnan and Thompson's inherent likability and natural chemistry, the two actors end up feeling more like old friends than a sizzling romantic item.
