The actors hit the jackpot, but only in terms of their paychecks. The audience gets a tension-free, tight-assed, Casino ripoff that leaves them thoroughly fleeced.
It looks like everybody's lying, and that's only because the acting is pretty bad.
The movie mostly wants to look timely and seem topical. Instead, it feels irrelevant.
Various subplots are given short shrift and the whole thing feels more like a Cliff's Notes version of a longer piece than an actual finished motion picture.
You want the movie to get outrageous, but it's too dignified to go there. Much like its central villain, it can't decide what it wants to be.
Ultimately, Runner Runner is really just a movie designed to provide some background noise as you update your Facebook.
Mixes the vacuous and tedious, slick and predictable, smarmy and smug. There's gambling lingo, racism or sleaziness spouting from the mouths of male a**holes, conversations steaming with banal bluster, and tropical scenes out of perfume and liqueur ads.
A bland retelling of a familiar story that lies in the shadow of smarter and sleeker films like 'The Firm.'
...it's ultimately impossible to downplay the rampant ineffectiveness of virtually every aspect of the proceedings.
Its pedigree may seem like a trump card, but make no mistake -- Runner Runner is bluffing.
Five years from now, I can see this movie constantly slotted on networks like USA and TNT to fill the programming gaps.
Justin Timberlake can not carry a movie on his own and this one sinks under his efforts. Still the plot of the movie is pretty much run of the mill in its own right
There's nothing glaringly wrong with it, but it's so glossily mediocre that it's impossible to recommend to anyone not contemplating a lengthy plane journey.
Stars Justin Timberlake, the perfect vanilla pseudoadult for a story of pseudoadult intrigues and pleasures.
Director Furman and cinematographer Mauro Fiore make lovely work of the tropical light, but the film has none of the loose-limbed energy of Furman's stealth hit, The Lincoln Lawyer.
This lurid and choppy morality tale is a pale copy of those Ben Mezrich books about Ivy League guys who get in over their heads by gambling.
Will Richie regain his moral compass? Can our young turk turn the tables on his scheming mentor? If you're hoping for a surprise answer to any of these questions, then you are watching the wrong movie.
The eye rolls are plentiful during this far-fetched thriller that provides little insight into corruption in the high-stakes world of online gambling.
No reason to run run to see Runner Runner.
Unremarkable Internet gambling thriller, where every move made is a losing one.
Runner Runner feels like a movie you've seen a hundred times on cable, and hearkens back to numerous, thoroughly average, mid-budgeted dramatic thrillers of the mid-'90s that will fill programming slots on late night forever.
