This giant turkey was produced, written, and directed by Roman Coppola, who must have thought the dumb fantasy sequences, steeped in movieland imagery, would remind people of 8-1/2 (or, at the very least, Head).
The audience finds out just how long 84 minutes can be. The answer: really long.
Perhaps the best thing that can be said about the film is that it adequately depicts the narcissism of its star ...
A film is a terrible thing to waste.
The execution ... is perilously self-absorbed ...
A movie that doesn't really seem to have any reason to exist, other than maybe to give writer and director Roman Coppola and star Charlie Sheen something to do for a few weeks.
It's rare to witness a film with such a profound disconnect between the director's intention and the final product. It's clear Coppola is striving for some kind of meaningful sublime statement but in reality he has created an interminably vacuous picture.
The what-the-heck-was-that? novelty wears off with astonishing speed once it sinks in that none of this is going anywhere.
Sheen is about as capable of playing a character who isn't Charlie Sheen as he is of playing a dog, or a muffin, or a bottle of shampoo.
a Walter Mitty approach to justify the decadent and pathetic life of Charlie Sheen
Director Roman Coppola is nothing if not soaked in movie lore.
When the subtlest part of your film is Charlie Sheen's performance, you've got a problem.
And that glimpse reveals that the mind of Charles Swan III is actually a bad movie.
An artist-playboy stalking an ex-girlfriend sounds tailor-made for Charlie Sheen, but he and his comedy are rather bland. A not quite fully formed film from Roman Coppola.
It allows moviegoers the dubious pleasure of experiencing what a film by the late Bob Fosse might have been like if only Fosse had been a moron.
Charles Swan III just needs to grow up. And unpleasant as it may be, we deserve more than a glimpse into his mind.
There isn't much interesting about delving into the psyche of a broad, meaningless caricature. Ooh, tell us about your rich internal life, Joe Camel!
Do we sympathize with Swann? Not remotely. Do we find his friends interesting? Not at all.
The guys play victims and lament the poor condition of being horny guys whose significant others won't just be happy with men who make no effort at all.
