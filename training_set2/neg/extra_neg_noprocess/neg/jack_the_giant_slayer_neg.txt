Forget that Giant Slayer feels photocopied and is entirely unnecessary. It's just not exciting.
A mash-up of old-school heroism, pantomime villainy, starstruck lovers and post-'Shrek' archness, it's more exhausting than exhilarating.
Not awful, not wonderful, Jack the Giant Slayer is a midrange fairy tale epic that's a lot more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum.
Underwhelming, as you might expect, but it's quite possibly the best Jack and the Beanstalk film you could imagine the studio system producing. Whatever that means.
When you make a movie this awful, with no hint of useful self-awareness, you're not proving a point--you're giving up.
When it really gets going, and especially in the last 30 minutes, it's passable as matinee fodder.
If anything "Jack the Giant Slayer" proves it's about time we begin inventing new fairytales.
Although a fairy tale, the movie is presented as a big-budget, special-effects blockbuster that plays as much like Clash of the Titans as a Disney cartoon. That places a lot of limitations on audience.
dull and perfunctory
Apparently spent most of its 'giant' $195 million budget on lavish, impressive special effects and nary a tinker's nickel on the ho-hum script.
The cast seem stilted, even a bit surprised, to find themselves in the fictitious land of Cloister, dressed in panto regalia with dreadful hair-dos, no doubt under orders to deliver their lines with a touch of deliberate theatricality.
Between the magic beans or a ticket to this film... maybe take the beans.
The family audience deserves better than this.
You don't know Jack. And, I'm not so sure you want to get to know him, because he's a bit on the bland side.
