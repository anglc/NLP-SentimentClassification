There simply isn't a whole lot of excitement being generated in this lackluster family adventure, though it tries oh so very hard.
The quest for the Midas Box never seems like more than a poor man's plot-engine substitute for Tolkien's One Ring.
Michael Sheen, Lena Heady and Sam Neill are among the big names expecting a franchise, but they'll be lucky to get a mid-morning TV slot, let alone a sequel.
The visually stylish film feels like a combination of elements from other fantasy adventures, yet turns out more muddled and convoluted than suspenseful.
For being a kids-centric film, the picture is relatively slow and joyless...
Meh and double meh on this movie.
The Adventurer: The Curse of the Midas Box could somewhat aptly be described as National Treasure in Victorian England. That is to say, it has that distinct feeling of being a tenth-generation ripoff of Raiders of the Lost Ark.
"This is horrible!" Sacha the seamstress says. "I have to get out of here!" She stole the thoughts right out of my brain as I watched Jonathan Newman's dismally directed, inert action movie The Adventurer: Curse of the Midas Box.
This elaborately constructed, visually appealing, well-cast adventure film should have worked, but is sunk by a singularly unmusical script and perfunctory handling.
Mere mention of buried treasure and amulets and so forth don't automatically mean international intrigue, which your little brother can tell you when he wakes up.
The film gradually reveals a lot of unsavory motives, which ultimately deflate the buoyant virtues on which the film had blithely coasted.
