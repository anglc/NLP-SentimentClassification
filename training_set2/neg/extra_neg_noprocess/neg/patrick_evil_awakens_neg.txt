It's a techno-thriller of brain-dead proportions ...
Patrick: Evil Awakens is an entirely forgettable horror flick that lets the great talent involved go to waste. There are certainly more entertaining low-budget horror offerings that you can waste an evening on.
"Patrick" isn't one for necessarily spinning its wheels, but it too often hurts itself by jumping the rails into insanity.
