The film's director, Peter Berg, wants to immerse you so deeply that you feel as if your bones are breaking, too. There's a price, of course, for that kind of immersion: It becomes tough to see the movie for the drum-beating.
Lone Survivor is a brutally effective movie, made by people who think that they're serving their country. But they're just making us coarser and more self-centered.
Lone Survivor comes off as a celebration of the martyred American soldier, that myth that makes it that much easier for old men to send young men to their deaths.
Knowing the outcome tends to lessen the intensity of the well-shot action sequences.
