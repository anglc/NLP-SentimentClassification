There's weighty material waiting to be processed here, but in "Little Red Wagon" it doesn't have a home.
Even the cheesiest inspirational flicks have to be populated with characters who have something at stake. Conflict is the heart of good storytelling, and "Little Red Wagon" is conflict-free to the point of catatonia.
Well-intentioned, but a little heavy-handed and manipulative.
The melodramatic storyline and moralizing tone are overbearing, and only O'Connor's performance rises above the level of a Hallmark Channel rerun.
Poorly executed heartwarming beats aside, Little Red Wagon does an excellent job of showing how a charity grows and functions.
"Little Red Wagon" almost seems better suited for a made-for-TV, Lifetime movie.
