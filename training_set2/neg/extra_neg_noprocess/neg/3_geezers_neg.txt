It is a remarkably unattractive-looking movie.
This is one terrible movie.
"3 Geezers" is painful: Simmons tags along doing his best Tim Allen impersonation, which is topped when Tim Allen himself shows up solely so the senior citizens can defecate in his bushes.
The film's self-aware mockumentary setup indicates that this is all meant to be taken as an exercise in self-deprecating rib-nudging, though the proceedings rarely rise to the occasion.
