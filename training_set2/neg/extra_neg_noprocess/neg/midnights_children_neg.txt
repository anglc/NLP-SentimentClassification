A film bloated by excess material.
The effort to pack an already overstuffed picaresque epic into a film of more than two hours ends up an indigestible stew.
The film is beautifully shot, with vivid production design. But because of the tale's lack of cohesion, it doesn't carry enough emotional heft.
Faithfully adapted from Salman Rushdie's award-winning 1981 novel, the movie feels both too packed and too slight, overflowing with vivid details but lacking the structure to support their weight.
A pretty but staidly linear epic drained of the novel's larkish, metaphorical sweep, and a collection of multi-generational love stories lacking their originally eccentric, fizzy charm.
Rushdie's script is faithful to his source novel to a fault. The lesson is that writers revisiting their work for another medium sometimes can't see the story for the words...
Teeming with personality and digestible flights of fancy, only to be crushed by the overall narrative responsibility, unable to juggle faces and places to satisfaction.
A sprawling, lumbering epic that manages to preserve a substantial amount of the book's content but achieves little of its magic.
Stirring, beautifully filmed and highly personal history of India does right by Salman Rushdie's celebrated novel.
