Road To Paloma features perhaps the most motorcycle-riding footage of any actor-directed vanity project since The Brown Bunny.
This film is numbingly dull, an outlaw-on-the-run saga as laconic and slow-moving as its fierce, hirsute protagonist.
Less a failure of competing or conflicting visions and more just a buffet of poorly executed meanderings.
All the visceral cut and paste art can't fully form Momoa's story.
... an earnest but formulaic story of redemption.
A one-note on-the-lam saga that's primarily notable for its simplistic celebration of the outlaw life through endless shots of writer/director/star Jason Momoa in sunset silhouette.
