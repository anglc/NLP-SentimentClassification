"Better Living Through Chemistry" as a whole feels rather superficial and safe.
By the time the film gets to its ridiculous stretch of an ending, we've all seen the great fun to be had with drugs while also learning of their danger. How convenient. How empty.
Sam Rockwell's committed performance can't save the glib debut of filmmakers Geoff Moore and David Posamentier.
An ill-conceived if mildly amusing comedy about middle-class ennui, sexual frustration, and drug abuse.
"Better Living Through Chemistry" ... is too much like the pretty suburbs it was shot in - neat and slick and comfortable. But ultimately, and deliberately, safe.
If nothing else, the directors have assembled an impressive, if underutilized cast.
It's got some of the comic-noir-y small town murder plot of 'To Die For' without the payoff. It's got some of the male midlife crisis of 'American Beauty' without the nuance.
Some chemicals, when combined, manage only to become inert.
It takes only half-hearted jabs at suburban angst and the pharmaceutical industry in favor of feel-good cuteness.
There are plenty of fine comedic moments in Better Living, it's just that the deeper exploration of life, expectations of and pursuit of happiness is as rote and exciting as getting a prescription filled.

It's a comedy that OD's on its own smug sense of entitlement.
The film is so divorced from the way humans actually behave that even the starring presence of Sam Rockwell can't save it.
When screenwriting manuals and college courses admonish aspiring filmmakers to use narration sparingly, if at all, and to show rather than tell, they're talking about movies like the dreadful new quirk-fest Better Living Through Chemistry.
"Better Living" never seems to know how seriously to take Doug's downward spiral - we get mixed signals on its commitment to its black-comedy potential. And the resolution feels wishy-washy.
