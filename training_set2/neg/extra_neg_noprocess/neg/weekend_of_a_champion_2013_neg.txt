"Weekend of a Champion" will appeal mostly to motor-racing enthusiasts and movie archaeologists.
Even racing aficionados might find the chitchat a little vague.
'Weekend of a Champion' is too diffuse and too light, and when it comes time for the big race itself, it founders.
I wonder if there isn't something a little bit placid and self-satisfied about the film, which is paced remarkably slowly, given the subject matter.
