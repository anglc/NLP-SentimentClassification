There's minimalist filmmaking that's quietly intriguing, and then there's emotional detachment that's stultifying to the point of being nap-inducing. War Story falls into the latter category.
Catherine Keener rarely gets the chance to grab the spotlight all for herself. That makes this turgid drama especially disappointing.
Indie dramas don't get much more oppressively dreary than War Story, a film every bit as distinctive and exciting as its generic title suggests.
Infuriatingly slow, enervating and basically empty contemplation of war's impact, and a waste of the formidable talent of a gallant Catherine Keener.
Mark Jackson's direction strips much of the agency from any character's grasp by insisting that their dilemmas can only be revealed with stone-faced austerity.
Exemplary actress Keener, through no fault of her own, is stuck in this sulky melodrama as a photographer scarred in war torn Libya. As for that conflict, forget about it. This could just as well be about deep depression brought on by a bad hair day.
Elusively told to the point of a irritation, joyless and shot in chilly incarcerating rooms, War Story has the look and feel of an exhausted ashtray and borders on the pretentiously unclear.
