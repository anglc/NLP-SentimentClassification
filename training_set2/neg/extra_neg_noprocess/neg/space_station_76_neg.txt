It's hard to say what the creators of "Space Station 76" were aiming for. But whatever it was, they didn't achieve it.
A protracted, scattershot comedy sketch that never quite nails its tone.
Overall, the film leans too much on tacky wallpaper, Todd Rundgren cuts, and Tyler's radiant niceness.
There's a lot to admire around the edges, but Plotnick's film isn't quite an out-of-this-world experience based on its own merits.
This retro-futuristic 'lust in space' melodrama is a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch that goes on far too long.
At its least dismal moments, the sci-fi comedy Space Station 76 plays something like Anchorman in space.
