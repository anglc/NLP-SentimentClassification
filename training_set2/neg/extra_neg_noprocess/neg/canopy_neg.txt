A brave experiment in stripped-down, visceral filmmaking, writer-director Aaron Wilson's World War II drama "Canopy" is ultimately upended by its minimalist conceit.
Much like his fly-boyflyboy underdog in the opening sequence, Wilson simply can't stick the landing.
Canopy doesn't fully convey the horror and the isolation these men must have experienced. It's a conceptually bold film but not a fully achieved one.
The plot is so perfunctory it's hard to gauge the intended meanings when the hero crosses paths with a Chinese counterpart (Mo Tzu-Yi), the only other significant character.
Although Canopy is far from the worst Australian film ever made, there will be few that will be as tedious.
