Jim Jarmusch's Only Lovers Left Alive is very pleasing to the eye and contains fine performances from its ensemble, but ultimately there is nothing beneath the surface to captivate the viewer's interest.
...Jarmusch seems content to eschew character development and plot advances in favor of a very specific (and palpable) mood.
