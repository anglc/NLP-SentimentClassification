While Mr. Nobody contains some truly moving scenes, it eventually starts to try your concentration when you suspect all the space/time continuum shuffling may never become more than the sum of its parts.
[Writer-director] Van Dormael seems unsure of what exactly it is he's trying to say, and thus Mr. Nobody rambles on for nearly two and a half hours.
There are times when the film is entirely lucid in the points it wants to get across on love and the various choices we have to make throughout our lives, while at other times it seems lost in its overabundance of possibilities.
Too clinical to have an emotional impact, not romantic enough to engage a standard audience, and not smart enough for viewers looking for an intellectual experience.
At the 44-minute mark (I checked) of 'Mr. Nobody,' I loudly sighed and asked, "Good God, when the hell is this movie going to START!"
The only truly graspable notion the film can be said to put forth is one of increasingly tedious sci-fi-romantic genre busy-ness.
The aptly titled Nobody is just a white ball bouncing around the roulette wheel, as likely to land on this number as the next. It's fun to watch "Mr. Nobody" go round and round, but where it lands doesn't really matter to us.
'Mr. Nobody' jumps around in a rather haphazard way, so it seems too chaotic most of the time. It's creative, but quite perplexing.
