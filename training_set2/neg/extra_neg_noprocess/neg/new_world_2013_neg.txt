New World tries to expand the genre with nods to The Godfather but can't escape the over-the-top acting, expansive violence and overdone story typical of Seoul-made crime dramas.
Like many of his SK-action peers, director Park Hoon-jung has a knack for staging violent set pieces but comes up lacking in terms of character development, narrative clarity, etc.
Park's direction is sleek and assured, but lacking the dynamism that might help energize a film that-its title notwithstanding-comes off as dully old-school.
Reverse-engineered from several gangster classics, New World is like the knockoff shades and counterfeit wristwatches its antihero complains about: flashy but ultimately cheap.
This is action-thriller feather preening, but all the wit in the world can't hide the narrative sprawl that rots from within.
