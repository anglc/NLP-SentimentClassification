Somewhere in here there's a cogent, timely attack on the links between business and politics.
Most of the roles are so ambiguous you end up scratching your head in the final reel, and some of the loose ends are so irrelevant they seem to have ended up on the cutting-room floor.
What follows is not a review; it's an autopsy...one long (illustrated!) spoiler.
A complete mess, this drama is packed with sophomoric political ideas, unfocused storylines and inane dialogue.
the screenplay, filled with hackneyed implausibilities and trite characterization, constantly lets everyone down
Alarm bells started ringing when every terse exchange proved chuckle worthy.
A solidly old-fashioned crime thriller that ploughs the familiar furrow of cops, crooks and corruption in New York City.
Welcome to the broken city... where honorable anti-heroes with dark pasts can get double-crossed and mixed up with good guys who're really bad guys... where doing the right thing will put you IN TOO DEEP. It's a drag to be here.
Aside from feeling bemused and confused by the end, the web of deceit that's presented is not even vaguely believable.
Acting drunk looks easy but its certainly not. So when Wahlberg hits the bottle, we are treated to what must be the most laughable screen lush in cinema history.
