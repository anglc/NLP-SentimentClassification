The remake never manages to drum up much excitement for its sleepy hamlet rousing or for its characters, finally filled with purpose.
The filmmakers hope for a fable-like charm rather than gritty credibility, but the whole thing feels as cynical as the villagers' convoluted mission.
It's all very sweet. And a big stretch.
Loved Local Hero? Charmed by Waking Ned Devine? Then go watch Local Hero and Waking Ned Devine.
At best, this aspires to the whimsical charm of Local Hero; at worst, it simply steals from it.
A comedy drama that offers a portrait of the Emerald Isle that is contrived in its quaintness.
It's a bit of a soppy, sappy film that wastes Gleeson's talent and incidentally appears to imply that bribing oil-company executives is a victimless crime.
Brendan Gleeson and Taylor Kitsch doggy-paddle awkwardly through this lacklustre fishing village comedy.
Gleeson is a strong anchor and brings some complexity to his part; it's just that he isn't served well by a script that too often mistakes bluntness for irony.
McKellar's take on class is a fib too far: low-grade laughs can't sweeten the sour message that any crap job will placate working folks. Think: Local Zero.
As harmless pablum, The Grand Seduction is mildly arousing, just don't expect it to follow through.
McKellar confuses hokum for charm almost as often as he mistakes stupidity for cleverness. It's meant to tug at the heart, but merely sets the eyes rolling.
