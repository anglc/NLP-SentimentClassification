I didn't like anything about the movie before discovering what Guy is up to. I actively hated it after I figured out what was actually going on.
The laughs in this film are all mean-spirited or just frat-boy gross.
In his directorial debut, Bateman casts himself as a foul-mouthed, racist jerk. It's a stretch for the nice-guy actor, but the role doesn't suit him.
Spell it b-o-g-u-s, because 'Bad Words' reveals very early that it won't even remain true to the dubious integrity of its ugliness.
The gangling script shows a compulsion to swerve away from sentimental expectations, but only manages to mire itself in affected anti-cute misanthropy.
It's just too damn amiable to be outrageous, and if it ain't outrageous, it's a swing-and-a-miss at the premise. Not good when playing in Pee Wee League.
Bad Words is clearly jockeying to be another Bad Santa, but because it frequently pulls back from going too far, it lacks that picture's killer instinct.
Plays out as a farce that (sadly) just isn't all that insightful, witty, or creative with how it approaches its premise - one that is kind of funny but only goes so far.
It wants to be politically incorrect, and indeed there are many rants against women, insults to visible minorities, and general verbal mayhem. But you get the sense the movie never means it: this a Hollywood lesson in redemption.
