The twister that comes to whirl Oscar into Oz is so preordained you could find its departure information and flight time from an airport travel board.
Oz the Great and Powerful is entirely serviceable family entertainment. Problem is, serviceable doesn't quite cut it when you're talking about the magical land of Oz.
Aside from a trio of witches that can hold its own with Eastwick's in the dishiness department, Oz the Great and Powerful is a peculiarly joyless occasion.
While the movie looks great and kicks into satisfying high gear as it heads toward the last act...the tinhorn feeling of the bulk...leaves one yearning for another trip down the yellow brick road-the one first glimpsed by audiences in 1939.
Just not the best director Sam Raimi is capable of offering his audience...
This is the kind of movie that doesn't so much rush off the screen as it prances off with its nose turned up in the air.
It strays so far from the whimsy and joy of the original that you forget the two films are even part of the same universe.
A poorly written film with a vibrant palette that cannot hide the wickedness in its soul.
Thick with director Sam Raimi's gonzo flourishes, but thin on character.
For a movie that looks gorgeous, evokes memories of a cinematic classic and boasts a bundle of star power, Oz the Great and Powerful is oddly flat.
It pushes its gospel of modern "magic" - one third science, one third show biz, one third motivational speech - with Disney Channel earnestness.
Raimi's 'Oz' is nothing more than a grand theft of a 74-year-old vision, thinly veiled in over-saturated colors and populated with action-figure friendly characters sure to set the Mouse's cash registers ringing.
True...the odds were stacked against Raimi in his film that has some moments but hardly seems momentous.
big and splashy but tin-eared
Looking backwards in more ways than one.
