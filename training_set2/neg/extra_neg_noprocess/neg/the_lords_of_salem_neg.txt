It's a credit to Zombie's interest in growing as an artist that he's drawing from more mature inspirations here, but it's also part of why the movie doesn't work.
It's all meant to be monstrous, unspeakable, blasphemous horror but it comes across more like a slightly dirty drawing, passed in seventh-grade religion class.
Considerable care goes into establishing the premise, but the film eventually abandons psychological subtlety for hallucinatory garishness, which is too bad.
Tries desperately to shock and offend, and succeeds only in being brutally boring.
I saw The Lords of Salem....I didn't really like it!
"The Lords of Salem" presents an even bigger mess than usual. As the film progresses, you get inklings of a plot here and there, but one never wholly materializes, making for an incoherent and extraordinarily dull affair.
Zombie fails to fully wrestle to the ground any of the movie's themes in an engaging or meaningful way... so its swan-dive into arbitrariness from the second act on is fairly complete.
Despite being based on the fascinating events of the 1692 Salem witch trials, The Lords of Salem sadly fails to offer anything exciting, thanks to a weak script, lack of scares and dreadful sound quality.
The Lords Of Salem starts as a magnificent slow-burn satanic thriller, but goes up in flames quicker than a witch in Salem after a horrendous third act.
Having the adorable Dee Wallace teamed with Judy Geeson and Patricia Quinn as the revived coven of witches was great. If the film had been about them, the film might have been good.
The Lords of Salem suffers far too much for its shortcomings; sadly, the audience suffers even more.
Zombie's moody shocker finds the part-time singer still floundering to find his voice as a filmmaker while offering clear-cut evidence that it takes more than a deep love of the horror genre to become a great horror director.
Witches gone wild, then and now. Zombie plays around with history as to whether or not witches have really existed. A reality rewrite regarding women historically persecuted for rebellious minds of their own, likely to leave especially feminists fuming.
