A film that's all airy, abstract pretentiousness.
It's a very brave and unapologetically cerebral approach to have taken, but it often feels like there's just too little there, too few life rings thrown to the average, non-art-student viewer, to keep us engaged.
There's considerable talent on display in Exhibition, but it's the kind of thing people mean when they use the term "art film" as a pejorative.
Well acted, and occasionally droll, this is an abstract piece of work that doesn't quite excavate enough character interest to compensate for the lack of narrative.
