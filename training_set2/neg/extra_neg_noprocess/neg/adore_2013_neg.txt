With its soap-operatic performances, bonkbuster plotline and sparkling seafront setting, all 'Adore' really lacks is a cameo from Alf Stewart
This isn't an Oedipus complex. This is a Preposterous complex.
Cast actresses with the skills that Naomi Watts and Robin Wright bring, give their obliviously icky story some arthouse visual lyricism, and you've got "Adore."
An exceedingly silly, sun-baked sex movie, the kind of import that adds just enough brains to its genitals to get into U.S. arthouses. (In the '70s, the mothers would have been played by Laura Antonelli and Sylvia Kristel.)
This film needed serious judgment: someone to rewrite the underwritten draft of the script and to have a firmer opinion on these terribly unappealing characters
The worst part of Adoration was when I returned to my car and had to pay for my parking, realising that the awfulness of the movie actually took a quantifiable toll on my life: 111 minutes, and $8.50.
Their world seems to hover between their own fantasy and the castrated culture which Fontaine creates. A nothingness envelops them
Melodramatic with a plot more suited to a TV soapie, Christopher Hampton's adaptation of Doris Lessing's 2003 novella The Grandmothers is overblown and totally unbelievable
The film never musters the humor nor the sex appeal to carry off its study of ultra-Freudian arrested development.
Adore is just completely absurd and melodramatic, where major things happen to our protagonists and they just brush it off.
Fontaine has trouble balancing the complexities. Both women express a world of conflicting emotions in their gazes, but the younger men seem lost in their roles.
Adore is nothing more than a hateful excuse for a piece of cinema. Avoid it at all costs.
Never goes into the dark, sordid territory a story such as this demands, and lacks the passion it deserves.
'Mommy Dearest,' indeed.
It makes for an ideal travelogue, for sure. But as a salacious dip into forbidden waters, it shoots nothing but blanks.
