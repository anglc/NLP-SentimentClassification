Utterly dismal, can't-quite-believe-it's-really-this-bad Scottish comedy that's inept on every conceivable level.
The film's main problem is that it's a good 25 minute short padded out to an hour and a half.
It's difficult to imagine that this will be of much interest to anyone, apart from the people who made it.
Feels more like mates mucking around with a camera than a proper movie.
The film has the knockabout feel of a kids' TV show on CBBC, which is no bad thing, but the comedy doesn't quite come together.
Low-budget caper about a stolen comic book that is, with the best will in the world, unfit for human consumption.
More geek creak than geek chic.
