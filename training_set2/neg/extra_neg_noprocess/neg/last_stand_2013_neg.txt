The weaponry is so ridiculously bountiful that the movie must be a defense against something. But it's just another lousy action movie. And for more than an hour, it's less than that.
Schwarzenegger can still hold the screen, but these days he grinds through his one-liners like a truck driver taking a steep hill ...
The result is diverting enough for a low-expectations Friday night, but the ingredients were in place for something more.
Not the most iconic choice for Schwarzenegger to announce that he's back, but not one that's completely prefab, either.
Director Jee-woon Kim (I Saw the Devil) handles the action sequences effectively if not spectacularly, though The Last Stand could have dispensed with the occasional attempts at sobriety and cut straight to the chase (or chases).
As action movies go, it's okay. There are some good ideas underneath and an attempt develop them, but only an attempt. And though time has moved on, Schwarzenegger himself hasn't. As a hero's triumphal return goes, it's more of a whimper.
The film, though underdeveloped, is rife with big guns, flippant one-liners, improbable battles, high-octane car chases and way too much testosterone - all the hallmarks of a classic Schwarzenegger film.
The gimmick of Schwarzenegger's return to cinema wears off quickly. A bland bullet riddled excuse for an action flick.
Mindless, dumb fun as Arnie grunts a few one liners and tries to terminate an escaped drug lord who's in a fast car and heading for freedom.
Surely the former governor of the state could have come across a better script for his return to the big screen in a starring role.
