An odd mix of beautifully bleak atmosphere and hammily mannered performances, "A Single Shot" is simultaneously understated and overpowering.
Both predictable and outlandish.
None of these characters, no matter how trashed-up for the down-market occasion, are believable.
The back story disappoints less for its convoluted nature than for its failure to create a convincing set of motivations for its characters.
A Single Shot is a confusing, overcomplicated little thriller.
A fascinating lead character can't overcome the familiarity of this atmospheric low-budget thriller.
The movie's general weariness - nothing happy happens here - transitions from tasteful to overbearing.
A Single Shot does not add up to anywhere near the sum of its parts, and as individually impressive as any of those parts might be (Rockwell), we are left with a film that, if not quite a Frankenstein's monster, is certainly patchworky.
Hillbilly noir, great cast, dueling beards.
The plot is predictable, but it takes almost two hours to tell because everyone has to chop their way through so much atmosphere.
