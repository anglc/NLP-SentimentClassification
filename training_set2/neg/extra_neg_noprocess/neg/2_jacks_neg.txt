Bernard Rose's fourth ultra-low-budget Tolstoy adaptation suffers from a slack narrative and abysmal dialogue.
Based very loosely on an early short story by Leo Tolstoy, "Two Jacks" has a much less interesting second act ...
Unfortunately, these inconsistencies cause more confusion than the magic Rose is presumably going for.
Mostly, it makes you feel like the only sober person at a party you can't leave.
Rose's apparent intent is to show how little of Hollywood's Golden Age magic is left today. In that, at least, he succeeds .
Inconsistent yet reverential, it's a truly trivial pursuit.
John Huston's shadow looms over the entire film, and as shadows go, it is long and very hard to get out from under.
Granted, the Tolstoy story had the benefit of internal monologues that clarified motivations and impulses. But a good film finds ways of doing this through gesture, expression and other artful ways. This is not a good film.
The embarrassingly low production value of Bernard Rose's 2 Jacks works symbiotically with the film's botched performances.
