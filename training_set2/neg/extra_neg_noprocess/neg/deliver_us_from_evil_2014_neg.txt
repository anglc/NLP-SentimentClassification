An impressively staged climactic exorcism compensates in part for the random, far-fetched storytelling that precedes it.
If you didn't know that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie, the boot prints on your eardrums would've clued you in.
Director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer, Paul Harris Boardman, deliver a routine procedural with unremarkable frights.
Director Scott Derrickson demonstrates a knack for atmosphere but little sense of pacing; some sequences are effectively spooky (particularly one set at the Bronx Zoo), though just as many feel uninspired.
It's time for Derrickson, who also directed The Exorcism of Emily Rose, to master a new ritual.
Scott Derrickson's "Deliver Us from Evil" suffers from an immense lack of originality, a bloated runtime of two hours, and pacing that makes a snail look fast.
'Sinister' director Scott Derrickson again delivers the (modest) goods in this old-school street-cop mystery-thriller in 'Exorcist' drag.
here evil comes from the Middle East, but is ultimately dispelled by American goodness, in a mapping of post-millennial geopolitics onto a simplistic Manichaean worldview.
It's scary, but it's also entertainment. It's scarentertainment. (That's awful. Forget I wrote that).
Written in stone or bellowed in Latin, guff is still guff.
Underneath the bland cop drama, blander domestic strife, and the pretty rote plot machinations this kind of genre movie requires, there is a pretty interesting subtext and conversation about the weight of guilt, faith and good versus evil.
The director Scott Derrickson seems uncertain as to whether he is making an exploitation pic intended to give audiences a few fairground-style thrills and frights, or a William Friedkin-style meditation on the nature of evil.
This is plodding, pedestrian, derivative stuff.
Those possessed people were so really brave, having to listen to all that Jim Morrison. The awful rhymes. The wretched allusions. The horror, the horror.
A competently handled but overly derivative spinetingler supposedly inspired by true events.
My faith, tested by use of the Doors as a Satanic conduit, vanished for ever the instant a possessed piano bashed out Pop Goes the Weasel.
With its Stygian production design and Bovril-on-the-lens aesthetic, the film works so hard to make an ordinary Bronx day feel like hell, you'll wonder what's left for the afterlife.
A rote police procedural conducted by a cardboard movie cop investigating a supposedly demonic evil that simply cannot compete with nonsupernatural reality.
The strong religious overtones are to be expected, but the way religion is depicted purely as a force for good comes across as distractingly preachy; it's a message delivered with all the nuance and balance of Fox News.
You'll be jolted a couple of times, but these aren't scares that will stay with you. How about retiring "based on a true story" in favour of "based on a good story"?
Sinister, solemn and so familiar you could write the Latin curses in your sleep. Contains a truly hellish amount of The Doors.
