There is precious little table-turning or real insight in "Decoding Deepak" - unless uncovering a passion for Starbucks and a preference for upscale hotels counts as takedown material.
While Decoding offers some tantalizing insights into the celebrity guru, the movie, at its core, is playing out daddy issues as the filmmaker wonders aloud about whether his dad has gotten too big for his britches.
Tthe film feels amateurish and leaves a lot to be desired as a documentary on one of the world's biggest spiritual icons.
Glossy tribute from a son to his eminent guru of a papa is not so different, even with all that spirituality, from recent film portraits of Katy Perry and Justin Bieber.
Unlike his father, Gotham Chopra is more interested in his own latent daddy issues than with questions of cosmic import.
