"All In" is a lesser effort in this franchise, but not without its charms.
Reuniting, or really, introducing, the gang is a gimmick. It's also self-destructive-cramming in all these characters chokes up the plot, and who watches a Step Up for the plot?
When the cast isn't dexterously spinning, "All In" turns into a promotional video for Caesars Palace.
Even by the standards of this franchise-and this genre in general-"Step Up All In" is pretty laughable.
The dancing is king. So if you can't stand the heat of competition, stay out of the kitchen.
When you remove the popping, locking, crunking and breaking from the equation, what is left is ... melodrama, shorthanded plotting, and lame characterisation.
Usually these films kick off with a splashy ensemble number to get everyone in the mood but here instead there's a deliberately deflating audition montage.
As its title suggests, this is pretty much the last throw of the dice for a dance saga that more ran out of juice a couple of sequels ago. The set-pieces, though, still deliver the requisite pizzazz.
Only a frolicking duet set to Bobby Brown breaks the monotony.
You know what's fun about old-school dance movies? They're happy. Even when someone is sad, you know that dancing somehow will make things right again.
Much amazing dance talent is again given dazzling showcase, but the sporadic bursts of cathartic joyfulness herein are fewer and further between than in any movie in the series.
Without Channing Tatum, the appeal of this faltering franchise fades, except for the dance sequences.
After its silly last installment, this series is now showing signs of growth and maturity but not enough to recommend the new feature.
