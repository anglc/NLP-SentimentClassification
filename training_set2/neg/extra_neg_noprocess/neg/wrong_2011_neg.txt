Dupieux makes the viewer work for it with Wrong. And it's not always worth the effort ...
Dupieux has to be applauded for creating a unique universe, but sometimes he seems stuck in it - to the point where we feel we're not always in on the joke.
In Wrong, reality and the world of the film will regularly upend themselves; it's never quite reliably clear, though, that these inexplicable events are happening for a purpose.
Dupieux's absurdism is simply muddled, masking the fact he doesn't really have much to say.
