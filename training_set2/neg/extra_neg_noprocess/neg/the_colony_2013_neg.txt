A zombie by any other name is still a zombie in this utterly routine horror pic.
A screaming, lunging, chomping chase movie that has nothing new to bring to a genre that just won't die.
It's somewhat low-rent and thoroughly humorless - hey, the future's not funny - and, in the manner of the genre, adamantly bleak.
Becomes yet another run-from-the-ghouls exercise, cheapening decent work by a good cast.
The film strands its archetypal characters in a featureless danger zone and gives them overly familiar dialogue borrowed from a dozen other B-movies.
Charlotte Sullivan looks really, really cute in blond dreadlocks. But she can't save the movie, nor can her impressive costars, Bill Paxton, Kevin Zegers, and Laurence Fishburne.
Rather than watching tough survivors taking on a deadly foe, we are watching something more akin to a low achieving mouse trying to fight off a gang of militant carpet beetles.
[Blu-ray Review] A pretty standard post-apocalyptic thriller, economical but unsure of what it wants to be.
Rote sci-fi dogma fails this flick well before the finish line.
Dull and formulaic, it's yet another wannabe post-apocalyptic thriller.
Formulaic post-apocalyptic thriller...when you don't especially care who lives and who dies, all the skull-crunching action doesn't amount to a hill of beans.
The filmmakers' aversion to any hint of storytelling originality means that the main impression "The Colony" leaves is one of almost stupefying over-familiarity.
Nothing in The Colony feels real. Not the emotions, the settings, the characters or even the cannibals.
Bill Paxton and Laurence Fishburne certainly add to the experience, but this is not a substantial enterprise, requiring a few extra beats of storytelling and panic to pass as a full cinematic meal.
The Colony could have been something so much more, but copy-cat genre blandness instead leaves viewers out in the cold.
