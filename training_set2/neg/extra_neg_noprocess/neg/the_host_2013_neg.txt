This is pretty silly stuff, Twi-lite if you will, but played with maximum solemnity, no discernible humor and minimal excitement.
[A] bizarre Saturday Night Live sketch about a girl with a bratty alien inside her.
The Host isn't very good as a romance. There's not very much passion on screen, which makes the film a poor cousin to Twilight.
The movie's structure is awkward. There's no real narrative thrust.
Those who found Twilight nauseating will find The Host has the same overlong runtime, cornball characters, and artificially pumped up romantic stakes.
The Host fails as a romance, but it also struggles as an adventure film. The body-snatching angle has been done before, and the aliens... aren't menacing enough.
Oh, the silly movies we must endure. "The Host" is perhaps one of the most brain-dead sci-fi love stories to come along in many years.
What sort of worked on the page crashes and burns on the screen, as even an actress of Ronan's caliber can't make these self-debates anything but ridiculous.
It's all very confusing, and not very interesting.
Beyond Meyer's trite-and-untrue formula (supernatural love triangle, exotic locale, family values and kisses as daring and transgressive), corpse-stiff dialogue, flat action sequences and a confused allegory make this movie particularly stultifying piffle
You might despise the 'Twilight' series and still find something to appreciate here...at least it's original.
Catnip for the cooing teen female set but far less engaging and rewarding for anyone else.
And you thought Twilight was bad...
This limply directed, solidly boring slice of sci-fi twaddle features humanoid aliens who spend much of their screen time staring blankly into the middle distance with glazed eyes. About 10 minutes into this dross, you'll know what that feels like.
Just like her Twilight series, Stephenie Meyer's 2008 novel The Host becomes another feature in which people are standing around and brooding ( ... ) Proof that it's not easy to make thoughts seem riveting when little is happening.
Niccol crafts some arresting imagery, though the slow pacing and droning new age score makes everything feel like an endless Ambien commercial.
Resistance is futile.
It's a reasonably intriguing premise, but the alien invasion soon takes a back seat to the kind of tiresome teen angst where crucial plot points hinge on a kiss.
So badly scripted, performed and directed that it literally destroyed my faith in humanity.
Three bodies plus four minds is some fertile arithmetic, but The Host can't be bothered with the intellectual or kinky ramifications of its setup.
There's much grave talk of souls in this sci-fi romance. Ironic, then, that it ends up being such a soulless and trifling affair.
It's bewildering how sci-fi aficionado Andrew Niccol ("Gattaca," "The Truman Show") could mastermind such a parasitic mess.
Yeah...um...no...don't ever do this again please.
Come back Bella and Edward - all is forgiven.
