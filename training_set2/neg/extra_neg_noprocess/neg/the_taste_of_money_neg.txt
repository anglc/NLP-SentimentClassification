This is a completely unenlightening cri de coeur against the most obvious targets of financial-spiritual discontent.
As the sexual, financial and criminal shenanigans get ever more complicated, absurd and melodramatic, the film becomes increasingly tiresome; it's not even possible to enjoy its excesses in a 'so bad it's good' way.
A trite and tangled potboiler that, despite its polemical pretensions, is just a glorified Korean domestic drama with classier couture and shapelier champagne flutes.
The director seems uncertain whether he is making a slow-burning character drama or a satirical gangster movie about modern-day Seoul's answer to the Borgias.
It feels like Im intended this as a moral fable. He should have played for laughs; material this blunt works best as satire.
A veritable orgy of vulgar melodrama, The Taste of Money might pass as satire if the conclusions drawn were not so broad and unsurprising.
This grotesque, luxe white-collar chamber drama from South Korea is often laughably bad.
A glossy, heavy-handed soap opera with all the complexity of a four-piece jigsaw puzzle.
Im Sangsoo seems too much in love with what he seeks to condemn for The Taste Of Money to have real bite.
The story bounces about in a fashion that's as chaotic as the film's visuals are placid, suffused with sumptuous malice.
