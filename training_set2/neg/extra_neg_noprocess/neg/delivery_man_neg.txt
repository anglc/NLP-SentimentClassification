A golden comic premise, directed to dross by Ken Scott, who also made the Canadian original ("Starbuck," from 2011) on which this Vince Vaughn vehicle is based.
Softer and schmaltzier than the original. Vince Vaughn has played this guy before, to better effect.
Calling Delivery Man a "comedy" is a bit of a stretch, because it's rarely funny. Dumb, yes, but not in a way that's worthy of more than a half-hearted chuckle.
Delivery Man can be pegged as yet another in a seemingly endless series of Apatow-era man-child redemption stories ...
Vaughn never quite convinces as the perpetual slacker in this blue-collar family (he doesn't even look like he's from the same gene pool) and too many of the characters feel puppeteered into place; you can see all the strings.
The sheer cognitive dissonance between being told that this character is nice and the baffling deception he pulls on hundreds of people is agonizing, and it makes the story horribly anti-dramatic.
'Delivery Man' is a little like the main character: just good enough to make you care a little and smile a lot.
Delivery Man starts off strong, but gradually fades into mediocrity courtesy of, well, just too much going on.
Vaughn gives his shiftless character a surprising degree of goofy charm, but he can't halt the film's inexorable slide into sentimentality and the limp script's lack of real wit leaves the endeavour looking misconceived.
"Everybody loves you", the fictional father of Vince Vaughn tells Vince Vaughn in Delivery Man, but he's obviously not read the box office reports on the star's last few movies.
Vaughn dials down his fast-talking schtick, but the story is often unconvincing (533 kids?) and there are very few laughs.
The tone wavers between the pantomime and the mawkish and while little has been lost in translation, less still has been gained.
It's warm-hearted, certainly, but ultimately undone by a would-be feelgood central conceit that makes less and less sense the more you think about it.
Alas, the hero is played by Vince Vaughn, a limited actor whose range extends from petulant to homicidal.
What is supposed to be funny and heartwarming is instead creepy and stalkerish. There's no charm or emotional plausibility in a tale that cannot work without it.
Vince Vaughn, alas, simply doesn't have the lightness of touch to give this film the charm it badly needs.
It's not exactly a relatable scenario, the plot is too thin and episodic and there are few laughs.
Vince Vaughn autopilots his way through this lame, contrived and strangely depressing high-concept comedy.
