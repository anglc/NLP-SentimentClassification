There's no doubt that D'Souza loves America, but he loves it much in the same way that we all do: According to a map of his own design.
"America" would be simply annoying if it were just preaching to the choir; what makes it unendurable is the fact that D'Souza and Sullivan can't craft a sermon that would keep even the choir awake, interested, and entertained.
You could bother debating D'Souza on history and semantics and rudimentary logic, but chances are you'd end up feeling like Meathead arguing with Archie Bunker.
Graced with a hilariously definitive title, America is astonishingly facile, a film comprised entirely of straw man arguments.
Hilariously, just minutes after reducing Occupy Wall Street to an assault on small hamburger shops, D'Souza attacks insurance companies and Wall Street executives as fellow travelers in Obamacare, this country's one unpardonable sin.
It's "Sesame Street"-style show and tell, complete with highly suggestive musical cues.

The actual problem with America is that it is structured poorly, with a third act that seems tacked on even though that's where it finally gets to the point.
D'Souza has a gift for stating his opponent's position without actually addressing it.
The ways D'Souza appropriates famous figures and misreads history (slavery wasn't so bad, because all civilizations did it, he argues at one point) are ludicrous.
The cinematic equivalent of one of those forwarded e-mails of mostly discredited "facts" that you receive from an uncle ...
D'Souza asks softball questions of those he agrees with ("What is your American dream?" he asks U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz) and leading questions of others, and his narration is peppered with generalities, platitudes and truisms.
