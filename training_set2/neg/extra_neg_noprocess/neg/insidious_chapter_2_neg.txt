Characters in Whannell/Wan screenplays speak with the first-draft expository bluntness of a cheap '50s thriller, letting the characters step on some of the best reveals.
Though there's some admirably clever plotting to interweave the film's second half with events in the original, it's simply not as scary.
Insidious: Chapter 2 is not only unnecessary but it commits the cardinal sin of devaluing its predecessor.
An increasing amount of metaphysical backtracking dilutes the few simple jolts that do work this time around.
This sequel to the horror hit about a boy lost in the demon-infested netherworld called The Further adds the element of time travel to its paranormal expeditions -- and sinks in its own murk.
The best horror films stay with you, leaving you jumping at the slightest sounds. This is decidedly not that kind of movie.
Wan and Whannell have attempted to do something interesting, but Chapter 2 - AKA Back To The Further - is overly complicated as a result. More repetitive than last time and less grounded.
Insidious: Chapter 2 has a number of issues, chief among them the fact that it recycles far too much of the first film, turning this into a dreadfully dull ghost story with no chills.
At this film's start, young Elise tells young Josh, "I promise, it won't hurt." You know that she knows this can't be so.
Clever isn't the same as scary. It's the unexplained, not the over-explained, that tingles the spine.
It relies on cheap thrills and fails to generate consistent suspense, while lacking the sharp sense of humor that kept the first film from bogging down.
Alas, the tension and fright remain mostly invisible in "Insidious: Chapter 2," the disappointing sequel to the terrific "Insidious."
The movie finds itself haunted by a three-headed beast: incoherence, illogicality and contrivance.
Director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell generate some cool scares and clever comic relief from Elise's junior colleagues, but a viewing of the first movie would benefit newbies.
Tedious and repetitive, it concludes with yet another creepy cliffhanger.
A clumsy and muddled follow up to the original; toomany tricks and not enough treats.
