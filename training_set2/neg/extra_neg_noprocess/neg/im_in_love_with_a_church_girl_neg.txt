Even having God on the production team can't save this 'Church Girl' from its heavy-handed sermonizing.
This overlong drama plays like a threefold infomercial: for Christianity, the cheesy resort chain Sandals and Jeff "Ja Rule" Atkins, the rapper-turned-actor playing drug kingpin Miles Montego.
A message film with the narrative sophistication of a recruiting pamphlet.
