Even the always-watchable Shannon can't give much life to Kuklinski's two-dimensional presence: he's little more than a series of murders and pained looks.
Michael Shannon is an overpowering actor, and in The Iceman, the best that he can do is wrestle the movie around him to a stalemate.
It's a fascinating subject - the beast that lurks inside the family man - but the movie blows it.
Lack of originality and insipid screenwriting may soon be read as the autopsy of this actively tiresome genre.
It's as though they were in a rush to get so much killing in that they forgot all of the important elements that would make us care. As a consequence, a fascinating story and character have been flattened and turned into a hurried mess.
An exploitation film trapped in the stifling body of a respectable crime drama.
The killings quickly begin to bleed into one another and it's sometimes hard to sort out the identities and roles of everyone involved.
The film is able to capture its period setting, but the script is a collection of generic Mafia dialogue and cliched violent shootouts.
Mistaking leaden atmosphere for gravitas, Vromen turns what could have been a vibrant period drama (it runs from the 1950s through to Kuklinski's arrest in 1986) into a sludgy ordeal ...
Unfortunately, the movie runs out of things to say about its monosyllabic hero within a half-hour, after which the killings become repetitive.
The Iceman is like a gangster's cold locker: all the nutritive items have been taken out to make room for the dead bodies.
Nothing else in Ariel Vromen's movie is remotely on Shannon's level, from the plodding, Scorsese-clone script to the needlessly lifeless editing and cinematography.
