Free Birds is not (sorry) a turkey of a film. But it doesn't really soar terribly high either.
The movie's animal rights, vegetarian message should go down easily with politically correct parents - at least until they choke on the offensive depiction of 17th-century turkeys as face-painted, headband-wearing native Americans.
Everything about "Free Birds" feels perfunctory, from its generic title and holiday setting to its starry voice cast and undistinguished use of 3-D.
A stale turkey hash that heaves a lot of ingredients in the oven but never turns on the gas, a frantic attempt to come up with an animated film built around Thanksgiving Day traditions.
A forgettable - and occasionally borderline offensive - animated tale of turkeys trying to take back Thanksgiving.
Any given scene from Free Birds seems more like a YouTube parody of stupid children's films than a piece of something that real human beings put together with honest artistic intent.
These birds are good to look at, and you can easily get caught up in the characters. But the situation is a bit too much to swallow . . . even for Thanksgiving.
This family-friendly animation gets off to an amusing start but soon flies off into la-la land.
The muddled story and lacklustre animation makes this a film that's strictly for the birds.
Anyone who's seen Chicken Run will wonder why they're not enjoying a well-constructed Aardman animation rather than attempting to make sense of this incoherent transatlantic trifle.
More of a Turkey Twizzler than a sizzler, Free Birds isn't funny enough to leave adults rolling in the aisles, nor does it have a sustained sense of peril to leave children on the edge of their seats.
Ultimately embarrassing and even offensive but has an offbeat premise, some neat characters and plenty of guffaw-worthy gags.
I can't bring myself to say that this film is a you-know-what. Let's just say that there should be no pardon. It deserves to die a death.
The animation is good but the plotting is too slow and unclear.
Surely Owen Wilson can do a lot better than a slipshod animation about time travelling turkeys?
This undercooked cartoon caper about a rogue turkey heading back in time to get his compadres off the menu for the Thanksgiving Day dinner fails to ruffle anything like a feather.
Free Birds lacks the humour, pathos or narrative skill of a proper children's film.
The script is furiously unfunny - in the 17th century part of the story we get a 'my wife's cooking' joke, which certainly feels like it belongs there ...
Disappointing, poorly thought out animated comedy that fails to deliver any decent laughs and is further let down by a slapdash script, some blatant product placement and a miscast Woody Harrelson.
Ultimately, Free Birds is a formulaic piece of cinema, and despite the relatively original idea, it doesn't go anywhere you don't expect it to, with so little risk taken along the way.
Not bootiful.
Even tykes will tell it to get stuffed.
