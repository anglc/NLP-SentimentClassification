Ziman struggles mightily to weave hot-girl assassin shtick, trendy exploitation style and future-shock grimness: The default setting seems to be whatever you've seen in a hundred other movies (and heard - the electronic score is pure digital Muzak).
Nasty for nastiness's sake, "Kite" drags to achieve its brief running time; you wonder whether the slow motion is an artistic device or a stalling tactic.
A kill-a-minute gore-a-thon whose twist is so obvious your grandma Edna will see it coming, "Kite" never gets off the ground.
Ziman pretends to be empowering his young heroine by putting a gun in her hand and tough words in her mouth. But there's something deeply discomforting about his camera's fetishistic leering.
In a film that pits the heroine directly against the sexualization of young women, the camera's gaze itself feels awfully exploitative.
Bloodthirsty young women are no longer novel enough that this watered-down revenger can expect us to pay attention without bringing something new to the table.
Filled with light parkour, terrible speed-ramping, and frenetically edited combat, Ziman's film could easily be repackaged as The Asylum's ripoff of Lucy.
It's impossible to get all worked up with a formulaic revenge story when the participants don't seem like they want to be here either.
Every exterior is foggy to diminish how far we can see... ie how far the production design could afford to make look like a rundown near future.
For anyone compiling a list of Samuel L. Jackson's worst films, you're in for a treat. Kite will be hard to beat.
Dabbling in the same fetish-feminism and coldly-served revenge fantasies that made Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch such a wildly divisive work...Ralph Ziman brings an appropriately seedy but miserably downbeat aesthetic to this long-in-development adaptation.
Worse than any Uwe Boll movie. Just terrible.
