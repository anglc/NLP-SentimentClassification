If the real triumph of the Tea Party is getting middle- and working-class citizens to vote against their own best interests, it's going to take a documentary more passionate and more revelatory than this one to make that point.
"Citizen Koch" is undisciplined and depressing, yet still strangely worthwhile.
For those who didn't know how flawed and manipulated the act of casting a ballot has become, "Citizen Koch" is a decent primer, but for everyone else long past the tipping point, this is just more evidence for a problem that currently has no solution.
It tosses out a lot of information and doesn't pull it into a compelling movie.
As well-argued as it is, it lacks any real personality -- and so getting people to listen will be a challenge.
...a well-meaning documentary that is essentially unsatisfying because it takes on too many issues and allots its screen time unwisely.
It has about four good ideas for a feature documentary, though none of them quite lands.
It appears the filmmakers had noble intentions in revealing the inequity of influence from wealthy donors, i.e., the Koch brothers, "Citizen Koch" is muddied in its attempt. It fails to deliver its intended message...wake up, America, or we're screwed!
Though "Citizen Koch" attempts to be a hard-hitting documentary about the influx of obscene amounts of money from right-wing organizations funded by the Koch brothers, it falls short on many levels.
