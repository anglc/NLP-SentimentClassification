If Cronenberg's not yet a dead ringer for his iconic dad, he's taken an intriguing first step.
The pace is uneven, the energy sluggish (even the arrival of Malcolm McDowell in the third act doesn't pep things up) and the film feels overlong.
What Jones hasn't been given is a character to play. Syd is a cipher, neither sympathetic nor hateful, nor even interestingly human.
Eventually the clammy spell of this handsomely designed but solemnly paced movie begins to wear off, and you long for a little action or at least some fresh air.
Before long, the aggressive sleekness of Antiviral becomes its own kind of ennui.
...a ridiculous and flat-out dumb premise that's employed to terminally underwhelming effect by Cronenberg...
As pretentious as it is boring.
While Brandon Cronenberg surely lives up to the family name, I can't prescribe Antiviral to anyone needing an exciting sci-fi fix.
If weirdness was all that mattered, Antiviral would be a must-see.
As a piss-take of society's shallow fascination with Kardashian-like nobodies, Antiviral is coolly effective, but there's little insight into the psychology that drives normal people to fixate on such 'celebrities'.
A slick, vapid thriller. Cronenberg has style and flair, but his all-too-obvious ideas about fame leave us with caricatures, not characters.
