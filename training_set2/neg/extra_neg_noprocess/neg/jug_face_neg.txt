This morbid, cruel movie seems leached of all things that might inadvertently give viewers pleasure.
Some low-budget manifestations of the supernatural jazz up the frights now and again, but as the novelty of worshiping a hole in the ground fades, the film paints itself into a corner.
Jug Face is part supernatural horror and part nutso cult escape flick, but it never fully commits to either.
Has a lot going for it at first but it's a film that ultimately frustrates by not knowing its own limitations.
