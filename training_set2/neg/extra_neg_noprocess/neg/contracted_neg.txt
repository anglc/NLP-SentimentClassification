There's no payoff to the paranoia.
A body-horror opus that will satisfy genre fans who like to be grossed out, but doesn't have much to offer on any other count.
Contracted is an efficiently icky, gross-out exercise in body horror that should please fans of this kind of thing. Still, the lack of any substance below the surface is ultimately too frustrating to ignore.
Our inability to identify with [Townshend] means we can't identify with the film's central horror, and thus "Contracted" isn't all that unsettling.
By being the director/writer and co-producer, England the writer didn't have an independent director to say, "Hey, the ending needs to be stronger!" or "What's the movie saying about lesbians having sex with men?"
None of it feels remotely believable but also isn't broadly defined enough to be satire, falling in that dull gap in the middle.
It's hard to make out what, if anything, writer-director Eric England is trying to say about the fragility of the flesh with Contracted, which amounts to little more than a slow-motion replay of The Fly's central gross-out.
Ultimately disappointing due to an inane script which fashions a thoroughly unlikable, idiotic protagonist who invites derision more than sympathy.
