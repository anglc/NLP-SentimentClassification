Khumba, despite being resoundingly terrible, will probably appeal to children in the same way that a Lucky Charms commercial or an inflatable bouncy castle would.
The animation is vibrant and the voice cast impressive... So it's a great shame that the animators and actors are let down by the meandering plot and trite dialogue.
The kids' movie market is crowded with superior specimens; they'll eat Khumba alive.
A dearth of new and interesting ideas characterises this stock animated caper with furry critters a-plenty.
If it were a little worse then it might offer some mindless good fun.
Lovely animation and an abundance of comic relief should keep the tots engaged but this is not exactly The Lion King.
There's a pretty score of harmonic, Isicathamiya-influenced music, but this is a tedious time-killer for those desperate to keep kids occupied.
Everything is leftovers, from the lazy casting of dependable but typecast stars (Liam Neeson, Steve Buscemi), to a quest structure Robert McKee would dismiss as formulaic.
A flavourless concoction that tries to tap into the storytelling of a Madagascar or Lion King but falls well short of the humour and pathos of either.
"Khumba" is essentially cut-and-paste cinema. The film's creators borrow a lot from the "Madagascar" and "Ice Age" films, and while that doesn't sound that bad, "Khumba" is disastrously uninspired.
