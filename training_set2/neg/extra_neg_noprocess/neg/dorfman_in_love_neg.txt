Sara Rue delivers a charming and funny turn in this otherwise hopelessly formulaic rom-com.
Inoffensive to everyone besides the homeless living on L.A.'s skid row, whom Dorfman shies away from like they're soul-sucking dybbuks
The plotting is like uninspired Mad Libs and the premise so slight it's practically transparent. Nor is there much going on visually, beyond Jay's to-die-for loft.
The sentiments are heartfelt, but the execution is common.
The story is simple and predictable, harmlessly pleasant (except when it tries to be a little edgy; then it's just silly).
Brad Leong's "quirky" romantic comedy retreads ground that is already so well worn, everyone just slides right through.
It would all be rather unbearable without the effervescent personality of Rue, who is as gifted with selling wacky slapstick as she is the romantic drama.
The latest in a long line of films to pretend that when a plucky young woman isn't engaged or married, it must be a personal and professional Hiroshima.
Forced and unfunny portrait of a Young Woman as a Loser.
Sara Rue is charming as the title character in this generous, slightly fizzy character study of a woman on the verge. The story, however, lets her down.
The film's moral lesson is too contradictory to be taken seriously.
