In the best dramedies, of course, laughter and tears alternate seamlessly and gracefully, and you leave both entertained and enlightened. Alas, this isn't that film.
Occasionally, Hollywood will step forward with a family drama that actually manages to tinker with actual pain... "This Is Where I Leave You" has no edge, no darkness, no texture, no character to speak of.
The most charitable thing you can say about This Is Where I Leave You is that it is resolutely innocuous -- a nothing of a movie, neutered and sanitary.
Mawkish, self-satisfied and false, This Is Where I Leave You strenuously attempts to wring poignancy from its familial clashes and catharsis. More often, it's cringe-inducing.
This Is Where I Leave You amounts to everything I can't stand about certain American movies. It gathers too many good, smart actors and gives most of them almost nothing interesting to play.
...a misbegotten, ineffective adaptation.
Pretends to put the fun in dysfunctional-family dramedy when it's not dispensing little bromides in hard-to-swallow bulls**t pablum form. It's all the most sanitized, safe, shticky way to show kidults' lives getting complicated. Sickeningly self-involved.
"This is where I leave you" is what Warner Bros ought to have said after reading the script.
There is never long between jokes, which tend to be crude and single note, riffing on the idea of "normal" people doing wacky things.
... mostly feels like a failed sitcom pilot, with a normally reliable ensemble cast that's unfortunately squandered by the subpar material.
Once the many plot points have been ratcheted up, the solutions begin. Characters keep meeting in pairs, with Judd tentatively romancing former acquaintance Penny (Rose Byrne), for dialogue that states the obvious and leads to a rapprochement.
There are a few enjoyable moments, with Fey and Fonda making you wish they had a movie of their own, but sadly the narrative is more concerned with the boys, whose relationship crises are altogether more formulaic and less interesting.
