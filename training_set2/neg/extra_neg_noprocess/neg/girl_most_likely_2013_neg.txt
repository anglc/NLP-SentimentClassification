There are moments to make you honestly wish it were a better movie, and that the semi-autobiographical screenplay by Michelle Morgan didn't feel so much like a first draft.
Kristen Wiig's comic artistry and its melodramatic tinge are squandered in this frenetic, schematic comedy, which also lays waste to a fertile premise.
Nobody in this movie is really appealing enough to be much fun. The state of New Jersey should sue.
"Girl Most Likely" is a strange movie, in that it has the atmosphere of a comedy and some extreme characters set up to be comical, but there are really no funny scenes.
What a disappointment.
