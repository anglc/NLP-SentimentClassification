Persecuted squanders the talents of its impressive cast -- including James Remar, Bruce Davison, Fred Dalton Thompson and Dean Stockwell -- with its bizarre premise and inept execution.
A heavy-handed and didactic drama which also manages to be totally mushy in terms of the message it's trying to convey.
Just why one particular TV preacher is so all-fired important isn't clear, and neither is anything else about this overwrought mess.
Straw-man cinema doesn't get much more ludicrous than this heavy-handed, Christian-themed minister-on-the-run thriller.
The Lord works in mysterious ways but "Persecuted" works in blundering, obvious ways, straining a Christianity-under-attack theme through a dopey thriller.
Persecuted matches its conservative beliefs to an anachronistic narrative structure and dated cinematic execution.
Woe to the filmmakers of 'Persecuted.'
Lusko's leaden dialogue and heavy-handed symbolism is as unintentionally comical as the miscasting of Fox News host Gretchen Carlson as a journalist.
The movie's entire concept is fatally flawed.
The hero's allies pop up and disappear; killers are on his heels, then they aren't. And that whole business about the Christian evangelical leader whose father is a Catholic priest? Yeah, that doesn't get explained either.
If Persecuted wasn't such a dire thriller, its sweaty fear of pluralism might at least be amusing.
Miscast, miscalculated. And who is persecuting whom, here?
There's no attempt to convince us that the world is being corrupted by people who haven't accepted the Gospel; it merely assumes we agree with that idea.
