Visually impressive, but the script needed a big angry red pen taken to it. Oh, and does every character need to shuffle around like they're in a My Chemical Romance video clip?
The icy, stone-faced performances from an obviously committed young cast don't help matters.
Wasted on the Young packs an emotional and visual punch, yet its lack of likeable characters and inherently despairing attitude makes this one cynically violent trip back to the school yard.
Sadly the plot falls short of its director's aspirations, and given his obvious filmic talents this is all the more disappointing.
Part romantic tragedy, part ruthless thriller, Wasted on the Young is an impressive but ultimately unsettling cinematic experience.
A very ambitious film, but not always a coherent one.
