The movie criminally wastes Sam Neill and Rosamund Pike in barely there supporting roles, and the picture has exactly two tones: grim and gooey. They do not coexist harmoniously.
Whatever the intent of the filmmakers, a story that hinges on existential despair requires at least a modicum of emotional credulity.
Tackles the topic of life-ending despair with all the delicacy and grace of a Hallmark greeting card.
There's not much meat here - just a slightly smart setup without any followthrough.
"A Long Way Down" doesn't bother to explore its characters on any substantial level and comes close to offending in how flippant the whole thing is to the subject of suicide.
A very long way down indeed.
It lunges along in predictable fashion through a series of quirky contrivances that might be tasteless if they weren't so trite.
The film struggles with a meandering story and superficial characters who do little to elicit compassion from the audience.
There are moments of tenderness and honest human emotion buried in the frustrating "A Long Way Down" but one has to work far too hard and give far too much credit to the over-qualified cast to grab at them.
The plot of A Long Way Down is as awkward and annoying as they come, but some really good acting by the film's four major stars almost makes this one worth seeing. Almost.
Largely stripped of their inner monologues, the same characters merely seem like they're stuck in a crass sitcom.
