As hard as we howled at the ghastliness being projected on the wall above us, I didn't see anyone at the Sharknado party who was giving the film his or her full attention, especially after the first 30 minutes.
In other words, if you're in the Sharknado fan club, you'll probably like the sequel. If not, you'll probably ignore it and watch something else. In either case, enjoy.
Sharknado 2 doesn't need any jokes about jumping the shark.
I can sit here and tell you the million and one ways Sharknado 2: The Second One is a pitiful failure, but that doesn't really matter since we'll be in the same situation next year discussing yet another Sharknado.
As an outrageous entity, it holds absolutely nothing back.
While I kind of love the opening sequence, Sharknado 2 drags for a large chunk after that and, honestly, doesn't have enough insane action to really say it completely works as B-movie escapism.
