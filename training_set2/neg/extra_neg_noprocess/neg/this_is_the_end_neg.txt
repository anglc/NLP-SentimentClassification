Writers Rogen and Goldberg run out of ideas before the second act and just half a** it until the end credits...
The loose structure lazily rushes out plot points late in the game
The best thing about This Is the End is playing "spot-the-celebrity" in the early frames. Do this, and you'll find everyone from Jason Segel to David Krumholtz. If all that talent were put to better use, the film might have been worth watching.
If your tolerance for druggy banter and puerile sex gags is low then the idea of facing Armageddon with Rogen and his chums will probably strike you as hell.
At its best it's a film about people getting lost in the fiction of their own creations.
