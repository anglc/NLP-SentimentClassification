Tepid and predictable ...
Feels like a religious tract more than a movie.
Slick, sophisticated but bland, with that faith-based film curse of having little humor and no edge at all.
Don't suspect any surprises: It is a Christian film and demonstrates melodramatic TV strategies. Still, on its own terms it is entertaining.
