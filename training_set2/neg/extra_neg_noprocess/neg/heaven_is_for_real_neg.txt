This is a big-tent Christian film that wriggles around a lot seeking to accommodate multiple varieties of religious experience, and ends up terminally infected with the virus of postmodern relativism.
There's no antagonist, no resolution, and no real climax - just a series of mildly charming scenes in which Colton shares heavenly knowledge while his family reacts with awestruck tears.
It's really just more numbing propaganda.
Christians may shout hallelujah that faith-based films are arriving in theaters, but believers should pray for something much better.
While the film makes decent use of the plains of Nebraska to give us a portrait of smalltown Red States America, there's a hectoring, insincere feel to this project that renders it practically unwatchable.
You'd think any movie that an all-powerful deity had a hand in would be awesome, right? Turns out, not so much. There's barely even a story here.
This latest spot of cinevangelism at least sports a theatrical heft ...
...a bottom-of-the-barrel drama that's been geared towards the lowest common denominator.
...will no doubt fill a niche, but a more satisfying movie could have been made had the filmmakers followed Iris DeMent's advice and simply let the mystery be.
The movie's visions of a greenscreen afterlife of digital angels and a Jesus who resembles Dan Fogelberg on the cover of the 'Greatest Hits' album is more trite than inspiring, yet the film is smart enough to recognize the weirdness of its premise
It's not great filmmaking, or even good filmmaking for that matter, but you may find yourself saying "Amen" nevertheless.
Don't be fooled, it's not hope or love that Heaven Is For Real is peddling. It's a divisive paean to a bogus cultural divide created by a coalition of opportunists who don't mind making money selling that same poisonous lie.
Things get sticky when the film changes the actual content of Colton's visions, and the lessons that both Colton and his father draw from those visions.
A sermon. Some will get it, and for those who don't it doesn't matter.
The earnest performances aren't enough to elevate the vanilla narrative from a faith-based film that will only preach to the choir.
