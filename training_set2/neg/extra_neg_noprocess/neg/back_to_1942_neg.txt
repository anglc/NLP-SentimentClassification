Director Feng Xiaogang captures the epic scale of the exodus as well as the often-harrowing details, yet emotional connection proves more elusive.
A chronicle of unrelenting misery, sorrow and human degradation that has powerful moments but is hardly uplifting.
It catalogs agony without making you feel it.
Shifting between individual suffering (performed, not felt) and extended political and business deliberations, the pic displays its budget but not its heart.
There is surprisingly little emotional resonance with the well-drawn and acted characters, making it a tiring two and a half hour trek for filmgoers who don't have a stake in the history it recounts.
The resulting, highly uneven film excels at dramatic set pieces, but stumbles in the sections that link them together.
