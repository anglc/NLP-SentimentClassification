Neither the very relaxed pace of this builder, Chris Overing, nor Mr. Stone's sporadically amusing neuroses about his filmmaking make for a gripping documentary.
"Sometimes you start things, and you don't know exactly why," muses filmmaker Bill Stone, surely expressing the feelings of everyone who buys a ticket to his aimless, and seemingly endless, documentary.

Navel-gazing documentary that's less about the subject-the building of a stone wall-than about the filmmaker obsessing over the subject and himself. Vocally. Continuously. Numbingly.
