Gebbe elicits strong performances from her actors and succeeds in inspiring a certain sick fascination with the material, yet the film's oppressive unpleasantness yields no new insights into psychology or religious faith.
Gebbe appears to be a misanthrope who subjects her male protagonist to senseless cruelty.
Its world is so remote, its characters behavior so unexplained - despite the fact that the film is based on true events - that our connection to the story slackens significantly over time.
If Gebbe is trying to say something about the opiate of religion or the social conditions that lead homeless teens into bad situations, it's muddled -- rather than sharpened -- by the ultimately numbing graphic violence.
Writer-director Katrin Gebbe rubs viewers' faces in this dog dish of a film, with the promise that some sliver of transcendence will redeem it. But it's all dog dish.
If you choose to go see it, you can make up your own mind. By the third act, however, you might wish that you had stayed home.
A film so comprehensively miscalculated in its desire to be a batshit think piece that it potentially creates a new category of offense.
