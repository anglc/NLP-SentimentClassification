[A] remarkably tepid sequel to the surprise 2010 hit ...
The first act of Despicable Me 2 is so winning and engaging that it's almost a tragedy how the rest of the film falls into bargain basement formula.
Franchises are born more from box-office success than creative necessity, and this sequel has only a fraction of the originality demonstrated by its predecessor.
The beautiful digital animation is state of the art but the story and comedy are utter cliche.
The story is unfocused, and capped by a resolution that has notable holes in reason, but even that could be forgiven in a cartoon with an arsenal of laughs.
