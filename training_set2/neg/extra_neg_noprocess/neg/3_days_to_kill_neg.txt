Charlie's Angels director McG used to know how to marshal a decent action scene (if nothing else), but that touch seems to have deserted him.
Every gag is premised on the fact that Renner allows his work and personal lives to overlap, though this contradicts everything we've been told about him and would obviously heighten the risk to his loved ones.
The movie never finds a way to blend the emotional and the rat-a-tat-tat into one seamless package the way that Besson did in his one and only good movie, The Professional.
How did 3 Days to Kill, which doesn't have the worst imaginable premise, turn out this bad?
To the degree that the film works, it's because Costner plays the straight man.
( ... ) a mindlessly entertaining, disjointed, frequently unbelievable hell-for-leather action adventure.
Fine, in a mid-budget, wholly inconsequential way.
3 Days to Kill is a frequently bizarre, never boring mash-up that doesn't come together yet perfectly encapsulates everything both good and bad about Luc Besson's recent output
Something very special: a Kevin Costner vehicle that makes both The Postman and Waterworld seem fearsomely substantial.
This time the Taken formula of ultra-violence and sentiment fails to deliver the same guilty-pleasure thrills.
The director McG seems uncertain whether he should concentrate on the action or the family drama.
If it's meant to be a spy movie, it's not exciting. If it's meant to be a comedy, it's not funny. If it's meant to be dumb, absurd, and risible, it's a success.
Far too generic and cliched, and offers very little we haven't seen before.
On paper, this genre flick looks like an attempt to do for Kevin Costner what Taken did for Liam Neeson. Unfortunately, it doesn't have Taken's pace and energy, despite the writing presence of Luc Besson in both movies.
Costner might not be the box-office draw he once was but surely he can find better things to do than this dismal Europudding?
Seeks to reposition Kevin Costner as a Neesony badass dad, casting him as a growly CIA type using a Parisian layover to juggle terrorist-offing with teaching daughter Hailee Steinfeld how to ride a bike.
The film is just stupefyingly bad, failing to be funny whenever it isn't failing to be Taken, and wittering on forever like a lunatic on a bench.
Some sort of lazily conceived exercise designed to distract undemanding teens and people too knackered to follow anything of substance after a hard day's work.
Kevin Costner tries his hand at a Neeson-style B-movie and accidentally heralds the death of cinema as we know it.
For the most part it's a confused and poorly written mixture of thriller and sentimental comedy-drama that struggles to find the right tone.
Neither director McG nor writer Luc Besson are known for their austere realism, so expect rampant witlessness among all the bone-crunching, blood-spraying action.
