It just about works as an exercise in empty style, but that doesn't compensate for the small matter of its near-total incomprehensibility.
Like a quadruple disc concept album from the most indulgent prog-rock act of the 1970s, this is a complete mess.
The whole thing takes itself so seriously it's not even good for a laugh. Maybe it's scarier if you play it backwards.
Occult thriller Reverb soon gets bogged down in implausibility and sloppy writing.
In the end, this looks like just another crass, unimaginative and heavy-handed British horror. A shame, because the opening 20 minutes or so are interesting and atmospherically creepy.
Eitan Arrusi's movie appears to have been shot through dirty glass and edited in a blender - it may drive you mad.

Its influences, from The Conversation to The Shining, are worn like cheap tattoos, while its jittery editing and blurred photography fail to hide the yawning emptiness at its centre.
Badly directed, poorly written and ultimately scare-free British horror flick that looks embarrassingly cheap and completely wastes its talented cast.
Early scenes, when strange sounds fill the studio and a phone keeps ringing, are creepy enough - but when a hidden message is detected on a track, the film crumbles from tinnitus.
