The Banshee Chapter can't seem to decide if it wants to be a found-footage horror movie, or a more traditional one. To its detriment, it splits the difference.
The film avoids any real attempt at constructing scarily effective set-pieces in favour of having one of the unnamed entities pop screeching out of the dark whack-a-mole-style every few minutes.
More unsettling than actually scary, this slow-burning horror movie is directed and acted with style even though the script feels rather under-developed.
Not scary. And you can't have the non-found-footage part be as wobbly as the found-footage parts.
