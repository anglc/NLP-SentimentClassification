"I have a feeling this is going to ... suck," one of these awful characters whines. She's not wrong.
It's endless padding, and laughable acting, followed by zero pay off, in the end.
The script has a couple interesting ideas at its core, but the film doesn't really have the resources to convincingly pull off its period piece flashbacks, or even sustain tension for long stretches.
