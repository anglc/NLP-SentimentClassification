The few authentic inspirations to be found in the movie's hundred and sixty-five roiling minutes involve gigantic science-fiction contrivances.
It barely matters whether this movie is good or bad. Bay is now the sort of filmmaker -- the only one, perhaps -- whose moviemaking goes beyond such binary banality.
In the end, though, this is still a movie about giant robots fighting each other, which is to say it's nearly impossible to take seriously on a narrative level.
Inflated, interminable and incoherent ...
You're either awestruck, dumbstruck or just plain struck in the face.
Long before Optimus Prime hoists his hulking metal frame onto the back of a giant robot dinosaur, wields his mighty sword and rides valiantly away to save the planet once more, Transformers: Age of Extinction plays like a parody ...
Transformers: Age of Extinction is as close to an incoherent mess of movement & noise as cinema gets. Michael Bay is slowly perfecting his brand of blockbuster, and to be honest it's getting quite compelling to watch him fall down this rabbit hole
Metal on metal still the name of the game
Transformers: Age of Extinction is simply more of the same mindless action, flat characters, and utter boredom that we've come to expect from these bloated mechanical sequels.
"...an excruciatingly monotonous plunge through the id of our cultural subconscious, which means that it might even be a decent allegory in spite of itself."
Transformers have souls, this movie repeatedly tells us, but does Michael Bay?
Like the generic, Hans Zimmer xerox-style score by Steve Jablonsky, and the lightweight, edgeless and comically earnest indie-pop soundtrack songs by Imagine Dragons, 'Age Of Extinction' is oddly anonymous and impersonal.
From its stereotypes and endlessly quipping tinpot has-been-bro-heroes to its brazen product placement, pandering to the Chinese market, and incessant bombast, this flick's the nadir of 21st-century F/X blockbusters--no weight or wonder, just clanking off
Transformers: Age of Extinction isn't so much a movie as it is a 165-minute propaganda film made to appeal to the widest demographic possible - but mainly for China.
The Transformers series returns with what just might be the worst entry yet...
It's worse than any of the previous three movies in the franchise and the worst, so far, of this year's parade of would-be 'blockbusters.'
