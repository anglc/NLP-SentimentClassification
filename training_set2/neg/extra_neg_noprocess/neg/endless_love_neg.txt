Is Brooke Shields truly obsession worthy? And can she carry, commercially, another movie about another kind of obsession? The answer is no.
A Cotton-candy rendition of Scott Spencer's powerful novel, Endless Love is a manipulative tale of a doomed romance which careens repeatedly between the credible and the ridiculous.
As excruciating as the Diana Ross/Lionel Richie title tune.
The movie as a whole does not understand the particular strengths of the novel that inspired it, does not convince us it understands adolescent love, does not seem to know its characters very well, and is a narrative and logical mess.
Anyone unfamiliar with the story of Scott Spencer's novel is bound to be mystified by Franco Zeffirelli's latest film, which reduces Endless Love to a whimperingly latter-day Romeo and Juliet with a little pyromania thrown in.
Vaguely interesting for causing controversy at the time, this tacky tale of illicit teenage romance hasn't aged particularly well.
A bad but commercially popular romantic melodrama, due to Brooke Shields' celeb status at the time and the the Oscar-nominated tune by Lionel Richie.
A potentially interesting story of obsessive teenage love is sabotaged by some laughably absurd overplotting.
A notorious disaster.
In a word: yuck.
