Firestarter wasn't great, but everyone involved survived... as you will if you ever feel the need to give it another look.
corny and overblown
More interested in special effects than in dramatic flare.
Bad movie. Bad career move. Bad in all respects.
"back off" indeed
Weak horror flick with sick overtones of pedophilia.
A whole lot of explosions punctuate a whole lot of blather ... and it's one of the most woefully miscast adaptations I've ever seen!
