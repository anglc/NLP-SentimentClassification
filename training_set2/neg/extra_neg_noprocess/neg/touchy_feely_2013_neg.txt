Despite its hints of New Age mysticism and serviceable performances from an able cast, Touchy Feely is too entrenched in its dour tone to be uplifting.
A work that gestures toward depths without truly plumbing them.
The kind of film that makes you wish they had perfected choose-your-own-adventure technology for movies, one that would allow you to ditch the central character and follow any number of the story's more interesting second bananas.
Innocuous then, but sadly lacking the wit and insight of Shelton's far superior Your Sister's Sister.
Everything feels sketchy and unformed in a film with promising elements that fail to gel.
Decent performances, but the film as a whole is a dramatic and thematic mess.
It has moments that are vaguely amusing or mildly insightful but more often it feels sluggish and insubstantial.
One of the dangers of going for intimate is ending up inward-looking. Such is the problem facing writer/director Lynn Shelton's modest dramedy.
Intermittently funny but erratically structured, it's a rare disappointment from Shelton.
This is a film that skims over the surface of something interesting but never gets at it. The energy passages remain stubbornly closed.
About as much fun as a dental visit.
"Touchy Feely" is light entertainment and well-acted. But, beyond that, pretty shallow.
The result is a disjointed and inconsequential film whose chakras are in urgent need of realignment.
There are some wonderful moments scattered throughout and a fantastically awkward performance by Josh Pais, but otherwise Touchy Feely is something of a mess.
A sharp ensemble cast cannot rescue this woefully contrived drama about a family struggling with connections and commitment.
