A tired premise and a sheen of desperate flop sweat tanks this DOA comedy, which plays more like an ancient Playboy doodle than a full-fledged movie.
Even for a farce, the situations stretch credulity far beyond the breaking point.
It's strange to watch a comedy full of talented people that does not work from the opening scene. It's like eating food and not tasting anything.
Sex Tape is warmer and more amusing than its ads would lead one to believe. In fact, it's almost good enough, leaning a little too hard on the innate likability of stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel.
Sex is treated first as brainless imperative, then as acrobatic duty, then as desperate consequence - it's never sexy in any way.
That's an awfully long way to go to establish a premise, especially for what little payoff Sex Tape ultimately delivers.
Can a movie be rife with profanity, nudity, vulgarity and sexual content, yet ultimately be as corny and wholesome as an Ozzie and Harriet episode? Unfortunately, yes.
The film's misfiring plot - it turns into a family farce by the finale - never quite makes enough sense to forgive it.
Why does a Sony movie function as a ninety minute commercial for Apple products?
Sweaty, naked panic is a poor substitute for genuinely raw humour, so the movie comes across like The Benny Hill Show, Uncut.
I counted three laughs in this wannabe bawdy comedy of errors, and one of them was a Breaking Bad gag so far past its tell-by date that even I got the joke.
Oh my, this is truly embarrassing.
Dreary and charmless.
Sex Tape is too busy blowing smoke up Apple's rear port to make any meaningful comment on the testy relationship between intimacy and technology.
This gormless farrago feels like the manifestation of a vast collective nervous breakdown.
It all feels terribly feeble and no matter how energetic and broad the comedy mugging of Diaz and an ill-looking Segel it rarely raises a laugh. What a right old Carry On.
Like cinematic contraception, this mirthless nonsense may put you off movies AND sex.
Limp.
Although it presents itself as a rude sex comedy, this movie is actually a prudish exercise in simplistic moralising.
Not especially funny or sexy.
Color me absolutely astonished that this is genuinely sweet and wholly sex-positive. Unfortunately, it's also completely unfunny.
Neither raunchy nor insightful enough, this Sex Tape underwhelms.
