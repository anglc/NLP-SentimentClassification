For No Good Reason sidelines Steadman's own bona fides, functioning primarily as a second-hand documentary of Thompson, stoking the hagiography of the late hipster icon.
Despite intending to expand upon Steadman's output and impact, the documentary boils the importance of his oeuvre down to the obvious.
Steadman's illustrations could burst with baroque details, but one thing you would never call them is "busy." They had a focus, a mission, that "For No Good Reason" often lacks.
The movie always circles back to Thompson, as if Steadman were a tetherball attached to the writer. In this way, Paul doesn't quite justify the need for a feature film about his subject (as opposed to, say, a profile segment on '60 Minutes').
Instead of embracing the chaotic discovery that Steadman personifies, the film ends up being merely a paint-by-numbers.
Paul's frenetic assemblage strives in vain for the cinematic equivalent of Steadman's splotchy urgency.
The artist often doesn't even get to take center stage in his own movie.
[A] low-key, workmanlike documentary.
Paul struggles to contain Steadman's profligate energies in 90 minutes, and the waning presence of Johnny Depp, loitering between poor career choices to pull on a cigarillo and point at pictures, can't give it shape.
