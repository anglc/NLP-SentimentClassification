Thanks for Sharing might best be described as being like Steve McQueen's sex-addiction drama, Shame, if it were rewritten by Neil Simon at his most schmaltzy.
It's frankly exhausting to keep up with these neurotic over-sharers, who are neither serious enough to care about nor humorous enough to laugh at.
At least most of the cast is appealing, with Mark Ruffalo, Gwyneth Paltrow, Josh Gad, and Alecia Moore (better known as pop singer Pink) delivering the uninspired dialogue with relative finesse.
Be warned: viewers may experience a violent urge to shake the characters, one by one, and tell them to get a life.
Thanks for Sharing is never quite crazy or funny enough to transcend its "disease-of-month" template.
You get a very talented ensemble, but the material just isn't strong enough, leading to a lot of star power, but no staying power.

Wildly inconsistent in tone, it is impossible to know whether the film aspires to comedy; it's certainly not funny.
An occasionally by turns dull, moving, funny, sobering and oddly explicit drama which feels a bit like Mike Leigh deflating Sex And The City.

Mature sex addiction dramedy has some highs, but also lows.
When Blumberg's film heads into more melodramatic territory, and attempts to impart lessons about what it means to live and love, it feels - and apologies for the phrasing - masturbatory.
The film settles into a more predictable pattern in the second half, when each of its three stories plays out an inevitable conflict that causes their demons to manifest themselves in melodramatic ways before allowing for a chance at redemption.
