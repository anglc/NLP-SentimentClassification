Inspiration seems to come from Groundhog Day, Beetlejuice and even The Shining.
A dull, confusing movie for which nobody bothered to provide a script.
The plot spirals into increasing fuzziness ...
The occasionally intriguing, but ultimately middling Haunter is caught in some kind of gauzy haunted-house purgatory between a girl-powered YA story and a ghostly serial-killer mystery.
A good performance from Breslin keeps tension alive, but hope for a really scary and inventive fright dies screaming in the basement.
Without distraction, attention can drift to the poor, cheesy lo-fi effects, which look as shifty as they did in Natali's 'Cypher,' but without the relentlessly nutty plot twists that jerk us merrily around.
...Natali's weakest film since 2003's Nothing...
Never completely loses the viewer's interest, but the edgy, enigmatic would-be momentum goes slack in the second half as the slim plot extends to 97 minutes when 80 would have made for a tauter experience.
"Haunter" has a solid setup, but the further Natali and King coax you into their labyrinth, the harder it becomes to appreciate what initially made their film so promising.
Regrettably, while Haunter is initially intriguing...it soon proves incapable of unraveling its conceit, except through excessively convoluted means.
anchored by a game performance by young Breslin, who deserves much, much better than this.
