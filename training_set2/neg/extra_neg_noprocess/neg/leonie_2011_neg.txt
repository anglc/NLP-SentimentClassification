It hits all the expected beats of a thoroughly vanilla biopic as an aging Leonie reflects on her unconventional life via plodding voiceover while doddering through a forest collecting berries.
As a portrait of female strength and a celebration of the artistic spirit, "Leonie" too seldom comes fully alive.
Failing to carve anything graceful or fluid out of a slab of biography, helmer Hisako Matsui does bring to light a curious and intriguing story of a great-woman-behind-a-great-man in Leonie.
Leonie Gilmour was almost certainly unusual and unusually self-reliant. Too bad that the film that bears her name ultimately reduces her to the mother of her child.
The movie is more enjoyable when pictures rather than words do the talking. Mortimer is wonderful, but her speeches are less memorable than the simple shots of Japanese flowers, fields and homes that Matsui uses as artistic grout to connect scenes.
Despite some nice period elements, it's a mostly sparkle-free affair, sticking so closely to the genre blueprint as to be generic.
