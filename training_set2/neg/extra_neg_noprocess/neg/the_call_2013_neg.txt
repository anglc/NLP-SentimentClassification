Just when the movie has us in its grasp, the script falls to pieces and turns into a crass female-in-peril button-pusher.
Crude as it is, The Call milks its jump scares and don't-go-down-to-the-basement tension for all they're worth. See it with a full house, if you absolutely must see it at all.
This is as brain-dead as a movie can be and it assumes the audience will have the I.Q. of a rutabaga.
For the first 45 minutes or so, The Call is surprisingly tense and effective. As soon as Berry leaves her desk, however, it unravels quicker than you can say "poodle perm".
It seems at odds with itself thanks to a generous helping of tropes from two distinctly different genres: fast-paced action thriller and creepy serial killer horror.
Rides completely off the rails by the finale, and the film seems to completely embrace its stupidity...
The Call delivers taut no-frills thrills for two-thirds of its brisk, hour-and-half running time. But the plot falls apart spectacularly as soon as Halle leaves the 911 control room and the ludicrous finale will leave you groaning.
A film that was just highly improbable for 75 minutes loses its mind thereafter and invites you to do the same.
While plausibility is often stretched to the limit, the sense of threat will keep you on the edge of your seat, even during a ridiculously gratuitous denouement.
