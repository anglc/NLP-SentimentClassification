For all its attempts at wonder and spectacle and play, Epic is mostly a slog.
Although the basic story is too juvenile and simplistic to entertain anyone with an age in the double-digit range, the themes and underlying ideas are too complicated to capture the attention of someone younger.
Director Chris Wedge falls into the common animator's trap of making the "human" characters a lot duller than the nonhuman creepy-crawlies.
A 3D eco-fantasy whose mantra-like insistence that we're all connected by nature is one of the main things that underscores the abject insincerity of the sentiment as the movie articulates it, "Epic" is very nearly epic in its stifling mediocrity.
Anyone over the age of 7 or so - not to mention their accompanying adults - isn't going to find too much here to truly engage them, let alone linger past the final fade out.
Boasts sometimes photorealistic animation and some cool concepts (the heroic 'Leafmen' ride hummingbirds like horses), but it's grounded by the cliche aspects of everything else.
I will now review this movie using the lyrics to the song "Epic" by Faith No More, which I think you'll find are eerily fitting.
At least it's pretty.
