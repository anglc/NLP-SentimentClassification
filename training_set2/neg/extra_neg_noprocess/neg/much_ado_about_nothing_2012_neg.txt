This fast and loose independent production is enjoyable as a home movie, but not much more.
There's no fire, and where their lines should ricochet with wit, they just spill forth, affably.
The Elizabethan speech rarely totally flows, the modern setting jars and not all the actors convince. It's as slick as you'd expect, if not a little forgettable. A frothy passion project.
Though it's not terrible, neither is it terribly good.
