Really, a movie as lame as this one doesn't merit the expenditure of snark.
Lowbrow, violent spoof with plenty of juvenile sex humor.
Even a spoof fan has his limits and this one very closely approaches it.
It's safe to say that no one in their right mind would find any of (this) clever or entertaining.
[The directors] are from the Seth McFarlane school of comedy, subscribing to the philosophy that if it's familiar, even vaguely, it must be funny...
It's safe to report that The Starving Games falls perfectly in line with their previous endeavors. That's critic code for, "Dear lord, this feature is insufferable, please make it stop."
"The Starving Games" has the look and feel of a talent show put on by a high school whose imminent closing has not inspired any noticeable public outcry.
Not so much a "film" as "83 minutes of terrible things happening on a screen."
To denigrate their dubious accomplishments is to repeat what everyone said seven years ago...proving that it doesn't need to be a movie, it just needs to be loud, obnoxious, familiar, and vaguely feature-length
83 minutes of rancorous stereotyping, lame bathroom gags and aimless, often bafflingly outdated film references.
