Flatly told and highly familiar.
One of those rambling European films with little plot but lots of atmosphere ...
This Italian romantic dramedy needs a little room service, because the romance, comedy and drama are sometimes in short supply.
Essentially a character study that lacks much character itself...elegant but ultimately slight.
A collection of carefully rendered details does not a movie make.
So slow-moving, the narrative takes forever to gain momentum, and when it finally does, it deliberately undercuts it.
