Beautifully shot, well acted, and the score is lovely, but the film has nothing to say about the human degradation in which it wallows. If you're gonna make me smell dung for two hours, at least fertilize my lawn.
There's no denying Franco's ambition, and in "Child of God" you can see evidence (almost for the first time) that he's reaching for something he may one day attain.
This wrong-headed adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's taut 1973 novel, as interpreted by director James Franco, spends too much time trying to create an element of compassion for this devilishly aberrant killer.
Too bad all this grungy intimacy renders him neither knowable nor fascinating as he hunkers down in a shack and then in a cavern that doubles as a crypt.
James Franco should be hailed for taking a crack at such dense and unforgiving material, but the relentless grimness leaves you numb rather than enlightened.
For obvious reasons too, it's a tough undertaking to endear sociopaths, serial killers and their ilk as something more, something human.
This drama loses its momentum when it focuses too much on its mentally unstable main character and never builds a solid narrative around him.
The physical experience of watching this no-frills movie is difficult.
A good faith but blank retelling of McCarthy's first major statement.
The Coens and John Hillcoat used McCarthy's novels as inroads and put their individual stamps on the material; Franco, meanwhile, contents himself with exploitation.
His handheld cameras dodge and weave, but that's all they do. Good handheld requires stealth craft; this is just someone flailing with a camera in their hands.
