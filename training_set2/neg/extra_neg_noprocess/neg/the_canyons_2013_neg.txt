It believes it's taking risks it actually has no interest in taking, that it's seeing profundity in the showbiz shallows.
Ellis throws in lots of references to social media in a desperate bid for cultural currency, while Schrader intersperses the drama with pretentious shots of boarded-up movie theaters to suggest this is all a metaphor for the death of cinema.
"The Canyons" is one of those movies that makes you feel worse just for having watched it.
If the creation of self-important tedium were a competitive sport, "The Canyons" would take home the gold.
An inept, misanthropic melodrama written by novelist Bret Easton Ellis and funded mostly through a Kickstarter campaign.
A tale of young, vapid, sexually insatiable Z-listers in Hollywood had the credentials to be deliciously awful fun but almost every time something tawdry (and potentially interesting) is about to happen, the film pulls its punches and leaves the action.
With the pungent combination of a script from novelist Bret Easton Ellis, a performance by Lindsay Lohan and direction by Paul Schrader, The Canyons might have been a micro-budget sensation, but sadly it reeks of laziness.
Schrader's idea of a modern-day noir has promise but Ellis' script lets him down and leaves the actors adrift with no scenes to play.
Merely confirms Schrader as an all-but spent force (it's been largely downhill since the dismal Dominion) and nails Bret Easton Ellis as a one-trick pony.
The Canyons is flawed in a number of ways, but it remains a genuinely curious proposition (no, seriously) due to the unusual nature of its production and the eclectic assortment of talent involved.
The first question you'll ask yourself while walking out of The Canyons is, "What were they thinking?" The second may be "Were they thinking at all?"
Largely set to go down as an embarrassing footnote in the careers of both its screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis and director Paul Schrader - unless, by some miracle, it gains cult success for its awfulness.
The group sex sessions are briefly interesting, not for their titillation value but the shifting powerplays that emerge between the main characters.
Lindsay Lohan's car crash career receives another nasty bump in The Canyons, a turgid, very low-budget wallow in Beverly Hills sleaze.
...feels like a toxic kiss-off note to Hollywood, and the only thing I'm really wondering about is whether Lohan and Deen (and others involved in the production) are the director's collaborators or victims.
It might have felt at home alongside various overly lurid thrillers from the late 1980s and early 1990s. Now, however, it feels only cheap and passe.
The Canyons is Easton Ellis cannibalising himself, Schrader badly forging Drive and hack stunt casting of a walking appendage and a starlet that should have been in rehab.
The weathered, wayward but undeniably talented Lohan, the poster child for Hollywood's indulgent lifestyle (frankly, it's sad that at 25 she already appears too old for the part), imbues Tara with a depth not evident in Ellis' script.
A boring failure, for the most un-thrilling reasons imaginable: the characters don't ring true, the dialogue is heinous, and most of the cast can't act.
The low-budget film is loaded with conversations about nothing in particular, along with a collection of sex scenes that are neither especially shocking nor titillating.
