This movie about Live Action Role Players (or LARPers) -- men and women who act out Dungeons and Dragons in real settings, in costumes -- is so haphazard it might have been thought up during a game of Mad Libs.
A one-note joke and a whiff of a story that fails to offer a single reason - literal or metaphorical - why dressing up as a fictional character is enjoyable or rewarding.
Supernatural slasher haunts a live-action role-playing game. The cast is clearly having fun, but none of it rubs off on us; Peter Dinklage and Steve Zahn are completely squandered.
Something went horribly wrong in the translation. Although spirited at times, Badassdom takes on familiar targets, while its escalation of oddity is forced when it isn't confusing.
While the LARPers are ostensibly treated with affection, the film still repeatedly goes for low-hanging comedy fruit such as the histrionic and incorrect olde-English-speak they use while in-game, an obvious gag that quickly grows tiresome.
