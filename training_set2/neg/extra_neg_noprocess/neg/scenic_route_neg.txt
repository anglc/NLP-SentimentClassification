Kyle Killen's script is generally uninspired and fairly predictable ...
Fogler impresses with some brooding edge, but neither he nor the location photography is enough to recommend you join him on this doomed trip.
Mitchell and Carter never extend beyond the archetypes of Unhappy Family Man and Bitter Failed Artist. Nor do Duhamel and Fogler's inconsistent performances breathe life into their flat characters.
Just because moviegoers begin to know these characters intimately doesn't mean they like them, or care whether they perish in the harsh conditions.
...it doesn't seem to be the journey as much as the destination: seeing two sorta-friends wailing on each other feels like the shortcut a better movie never made.
It's beautifully shot, has awesome performances from its two leads but just ultimately is marred by its inconsistent storytelling and brutally awful ending.
