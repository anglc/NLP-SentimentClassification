Ferrell and McKay were so determined to tell new Burgundy jokes that they didn't appear to care what they were about or whether they were any good.
The whole thing goes down like a second, giant tumbler of scotchy scotch scotch: familiar, comforting and, ultimately, numbing.
The unscripted, off-the-cuff joshing between Ferrell and co-stars Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and David Koechner this time fails to come up with enough good jokes, though they do hit the occasional satirical bull's eye.
A hulking, Rob Ford-like movie; a lazy, drunken-stupor mess. The non-comedy includes Burgundy telling his ex she's 'like a mentally ill whore having PMS from the 1800s.' Slapdash, flat, bloated (119 min.) and gratingly full of its own white-power bulls**t
A distressingly underwhelming sequel...
Anchorman 2 is louder, sillier and vastly more absurd than its now cult predecessor, but it's also longer, so when those less successful sequences miss the mark it feels like there are yawning chasms between laughs instead of beats.
