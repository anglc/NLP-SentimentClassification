Since every funny moment here involves cynicism, arrogance, heartlessness, and self-destruction, you never believe the movie when it's telling you how nice and contrite these characters are.
A generic, fitfully funny mainstream comedy that doesn't nearly get the best from its name-brand players but doesn't qualify as a desecration, either.
A veritable festival of bad toupees and repeated gags that just lie there, "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone'' runs a bit more than an hour and a half but seems much longer - like it had been edited down at the last minute.
...a serious disappointment that squanders its setup and talented cast...
A painfully tedious and unpleasant comedy completely void of any laughs.
Don Scardino's The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a middling and extremely dated comedy that only gets by because of Jim Carrey's over-the-top performance.
A slow, humdrum comedy that would have worked better as a 10-minute sketch than a feature film.
As a character, Burt Wonderstone runs counter to Steve Carell's inherent sweetness. In Carell's hands, Burt comes off as a 50-calorie Ron Burgundy. When he tightens his vocal cords to hit Ferrell's register, the strain is as visible as it is audible.
If the rest of the movie had put much thought into its characters as it did into that final scene, we'd have really had something.
Hot properties John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (Horrible Bosses) penned the script, and while it's another effort which lacks depth and real emotional involvement, they're certainly proving themselves as dependable, if not exceptional, talents.
You know a director is in trouble when you can barely keep your eyes open to ogle a scantily clad Olivia Wilde.
Everything that happens after it lets its abrasive character off the hook is completely predictable, but movies with this kind of pervasive silliness don't exist for their unpredictable plot lines-in fact they rely on predictability.
Magic-less.
4 good jokes do not a good comedy feature film make.
The cast members can't elevate this subpar material, although they do showcase an impressive array of sequined costumes and crazy wigs.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the whole thing is that you really want to like the movie.
This lame comedy lacks anything resembling amusement and magic - until the final credits which involve a sight gag.
Now you see it, and now you wish you really hadn't.
