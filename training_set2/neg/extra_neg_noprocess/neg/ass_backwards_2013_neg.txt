The road adventures they have along the way aren't funny, and once they reach the pageant, the comic payoff you're hoping for never materializes.
Where movie comedy teams once required a "straight" member - or so-called normal characters - off which to bounce stupidity or silliness, Raphael and Wilson believe total immersion in thickheadedness and failure is riot enough.
Raphael and Wilson are impressively committed to these misadventures, but it's a shame the movie is so cruel to the characters.
Wilson and Raphael have been a comedy team for years, and they riff off each other expertly; too often, however, that's all they do.
Chris Nelson's Ass Backwards certainly doesn't aspire to being anything more than passing entertainment. But sadly, this listless, flat, and exceptionally derivative movie doesn't even achieve that modest goal.
It's a little slapdash, a little flimsy, and doesn't seem to quite know what it wants to be at times, but it's good to see Raphael and Wilson get the chance to finally carry something for once.
This is a feature that opens and closes with shots of women urinating. No amount of high-beam comedic work is going save a picture that doesn't have much imagination to begin with.
The pessimistic, passive-aggressive "Ass Backwards" may have been written by women, but one would never guess it judging by the evidence onscreen.
Comedy can be fueled by desperation, but the characters are the ones who should be flailing wildly, not the writer-stars.
A below-90-minute running time is not even a silver lining to a film that lives up to its name in more ways than one.
