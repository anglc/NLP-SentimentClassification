The combustible possibilities surrounding a same-sex marriage involving partners of different nationalities is turned into rather tepid stuff in I Do.
Uneven comedy/drama tackles hot button issues like gay marriage and immigration.
A sweet, sincere, yet ultimately tepid story ...
Someday, when gay Americans enjoy full equality, we can all hope their sexuality will finally stop being used as fodder for dopey, hopelessly contrived dramas like "I Do."
In a better movie you might play along with contrived plot twists and fake obstacles, but watching "I Do," a movie with thin characters and a languorous pace, you find yourself talking back to the screen.
Ross's on-the-nose script offers little subtext or nuance, and the film-for all the inherent drama of the situation-has very little real-life grit.
Despite its heart being in the right place, I Do never does live up to its promise, thanks to melodramatic machinations and often preachy dialogue.
Banal, clunky and contrived.
It sounds like a sitcom plot, but "I Do," if you pardon the expression, plays it entirely straight. The drama covers predictable ground.
