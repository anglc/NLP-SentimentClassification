[It] may have the look of a prestige picture, but it plays more like a version of FDR's life as told by TMZ, focusing on naughty details and ignoring the historical implications of the events depicted.
A languid, tedious effort that never bothers to get to the heart of its characters, the film is a shallow reading of a significant time told mostly from the viewpoint of a lifeless character.
It's never a bad movie, but it can't quite gel into a good one either.
Hyde Park on the Hudson' is a forgettable historical footnote.
The potentially sordid FDR-and-Daisy half of the drama is feebly unrewarding, bordering on pointless, and bogged down by ponderous narration.
The movie is all setting, nothing but plates and countrysides and old cars and absolutely nothing to say. It's a real snore.
The possibilities are endless, but none of them are explored with any depth herein.
...you certainly could do worse than enjoy a fanciful little film about a gentle president, his supposedly homely lover and two twittish English people appalled by hot dogs. I just wish they'd gone ahead and changed the names.
The issue of FDR's fidelity remains a thorny topic for traditionalists and historians, never mind the light, fluffy - and ultimately disposable - version of events.
There is nothing stirring or sufficiently humorous to engage us; the fact that a serving US President is having secret affairs no longer shocks
Even Murray, who never fails to be the most watchable actor in any film, can't prevent Hyde Park On Hudson from being too insipid.
It's not the strongest premise for a movie, though Hyde Park on Hudson somehow contrives to make it seem rather less than the sum of its parts.
When the central drama concerns whether the Royal Couple will eat hot dogs or not, you can tell it's too slender a premise to hang on a film on.
FDR's story is strikingly relevant to how Paralympians strive so hard today to correct our perception of 'disability'.
Tedious PBS middle-brow fare, though not without a few amusing moments in this mostly forgettable historical pic.
It's icky stuff, not helped by Murray giving perhaps the worst performance of his career. And I include Garfield 2.
The film's special success resides in the women's hairdos.
