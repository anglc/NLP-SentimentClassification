There's something curiously underwhelming about the blood-soaked mayhem on display in Hatchet III.
Will there be a "Hatchet IV''? I shudder to think about it.
When the title of a movie consists of a number and the name of a tool, expectations are likely to be pretty low. So it feels somewhat incongruous to call "Hatchet III" a disappointment.
The crowd that likes these things will certainly be psyched. Everyone else, not so much.
