Though it will play well with genre diehards on video, the sometimes awkwardly shot doc is too fawning and narrow in scope to attract much of a crowd in theaters.
At length, the cheerleading (capped with fawning fanboys at San Diego Comic-Con) becomes a mildly taxing torrent. And Mr. Struzan, while an agreeable presence, is not an especially engrossing speaker.
The demure, self-effacing Struzan undermines Sharkey's strategy by insisting his art is only the product of a mundane creative process.
A movie that celebrates the work, but at the expense of contemporary John Alvin, who isn't just a glaring omission from the story, but in a couple of instances is actively obliterated from it.
There's a context to Struzan -- not just biographically, but culturally -- and while Sharkey seems to understand that, his movie, ironically, doesn't illustrate it particularly well.
