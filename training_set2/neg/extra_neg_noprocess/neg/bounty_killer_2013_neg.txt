Watching this movie feels like viewing a very long, expensive car commercial and waiting for the real film to begin.
Intentionally cheap, silly and bloody from beginning to end, "Bounty Killer" is custom-made for those seeking out self-aware garbage. To those: enjoy! To all others: beware.
Flat jokes, uneven performances, and a predictable romance help make "Bounty Killer" a lot less fun than it should be - a killer shame, given its boldly gonzo premise.
This slurry of B-movie hackwork boasts the odd spark of originality amid the full-bore blood-letting.
Bounty Killer is clearly the result of decades of watching movies like The Road Warrior, and has over-enthused fanboy ardor practically dripping off of it.
It's the kind of movie where a character cracks open a beer, saying "Now I can die a happy man" right before getting plugged by a sniper. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
It's a film that plays equally to both sides of the political spectrum, and it feels like pandering either way.
Are you consumed by an overwhelming desire to fork over the price of a movie ticket in order to see the kind of meagerly funded nonsense that the SyFy network provides for the price of a basic cable package?
