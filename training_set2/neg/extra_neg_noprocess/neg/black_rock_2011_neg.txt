The writing tanks while the actors try to stay above water, but nobody leaves a trace on the radar.
It seemed that Black Rock might take its very basic premise and use it as a platform to explore larger ideas. But even on its own terms as just a lean-and-mean genre exercise, this one's not all that interesting.
Aselton, you sure have a purty mouth, but what are you trying to say?
Black Rock is a simplistic, predictable thriller that fails to become engaging thanks to idiotic characters and a by the numbers approach that has the audience two steps ahead of them.
Aselton does demonstrate an assured touch in the early character-based scenes, but she lacks the same control when it comes to handling the action.
Poorly acted and unintentionally funny this is definitely a bad day at black rock.
A formulaic dirge, further let down by a lack of the shocks, scares and interesting characterisations.
On the whole Black Rock remains a short but sweet film, yet sadly, and despite the suspenseful atmosphere and enrapturement of certain scenes, is too forgettable a feature film.
The feminine approach is refreshing, but the novelty wears off quickly once a few of these actors decide to turn on the ham, making it difficult to buy much of what Black Rock is selling.
The ladies in Black Rock are supposed to be annoying. That's the only conclusion one can draw from their incessant whining, catfighting and drunk flirting.
