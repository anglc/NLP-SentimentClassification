John Cusack replays his role as a lethal operative with occupational angst for a routine thriller with a female cryptographer at secret CIA site. Dire workplace issues ensue.
A predictable hodgepodge of uninteresting psychological cat-and-mouse, dimly lighted action filmed by director Kasper Barfoed in standard-operating shaky-cam ...
This dreary spy drama is as flat and airless as the concrete bunker in which it unfolds.
Akerman does work hard to keep up the energy level. Cusack, though, seems bored by the superficial proceedings, which don't even offer the distraction of a real romantic connection or a suspenseful confrontation.
Cusack and Akerman scramble down a series of dimly lit, identical-looking passageways. The setting is as ill-defined as the characters.
A potentially intriguing idea is thrown out the window in this predictable low-budget thriller.
There's an interesting, timely idea in this espionage thriller, as well as adept leading actors who are able to make the most of the script's dry wit.
The Numbers Station is a cheap and predictable thriller that works only because of its two leading cast members: John Cusack and Malin Akerman.
'The Numbers Station' is a competent film and it does manage to create some tension. But you're conscious of the fact that it all feels familiar and wondering why there isn't a little more to it.
Cusack's glum visage immediately lays a wet blanket over Danish director Kasper Barfoed's English-language debut and keeps it firmly in place until the final fade-out.
It's little wonder the movie spends so much time running in circles when we see where it ultimately goes.
If you're looking for a dynamic, politically-tinged thriller, you could do a lot better, but you could also do a lot worse.
Claustrophobic and repetitive...a numbingly tedious would-be thriller.
Strictly for fans of the stars and perhaps those with an insatiable curiosity about career low points, the feature is certainly digestible, but rarely memorable.
