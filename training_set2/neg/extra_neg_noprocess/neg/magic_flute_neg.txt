Opera buffs shouldn't throw away their DVDs of Ingmar Bergman's 1975 TV movie.
Mozart in the Branagh meat grinder.
Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Mozart's opera The Magic Flute comes on strong ... maybe too strong...
His flamboyant rendering of the Mozart opera isn't as smug and stagey as Sleuth, but it is insufferable - and 40 minutes longer.
With James Conlon conducting, this Flute is perfectly in tune - so it's a shame Branagh keeps dropping it in the mud.
Despite the talent involved - Branagh is joined by Stephen Fry, who has written a new libretto - and the ambitious staging, this flute blows all right, but it's short on the magic.
