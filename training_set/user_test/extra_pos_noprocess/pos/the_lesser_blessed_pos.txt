Despite [the movie's] issues, Doron has no trouble capturing the haunting grace of place and people and the harsh realities faced by "The Lesser Blessed."
[Doron] has assembled a uniformly solid cast, starting with an impressive debut by Evans, whose brown eyes are both soulful and watchful. It's a performance that commands our attention and empathy.
A decently acted coming-of-age drama that scores points for its setting -- a Canadian Indian reservation high school.
