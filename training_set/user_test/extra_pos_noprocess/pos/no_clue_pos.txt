Brent Butt's Corner Gas brand of humour has plenty of loyal fans and if you enjoy his wry and self-effacing shtick, you'll find No Clue to be an inconsequential but pleasant diversion.
Although it's a relatively low-budget indie flick, I'd rate "No Clue" among my top three film noir/P.I. spoofs-right up there with "The Cheap Detective" (1978) and "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid" (1982).
