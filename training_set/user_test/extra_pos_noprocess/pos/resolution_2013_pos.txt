A strangely tense and humorous meta-narrative about two friends experiencing weird goings-on at a remote cabin.
A smart and chilling indie horror from co-directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead ...
Resolution makes its own creative crisis the star, trying to make something original out of elements so hackneyed, the filmmakers can't bear to reproduce them.
Ambiguity enlivens the smart, knotty Resolution, which routinely nods to its own artificiality while positing storytelling as a constantly evolving beast apt to save your life one moment and consume you the next.
"Resolution" is a notch above your average low-budget horror flick. It has the usual gore and scares and head-scratching events. But, the story is what locked me in.
Honest about the impulses of addiction, but could stand to have its core interpersonal conflict sharpened up some without sacrificing any of its overall narrative ambiguity.
One of the first things about Resolution that catches you off guard is the humor.
As a meditation on horror films, and even film itself, Resolution might be in danger of coming across as pretentious, if it weren't so damned entertaining throughout.
