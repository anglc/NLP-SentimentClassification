The heart of Hogan's film is in the right place, and Collette is masterful as an agent of anarchy.
Hilarious but a tonal bucking bronco, the effort is perhaps best reserved for viewers in the mood for a runaway mine cart viewing experience, willing to absorb all the chaos Hogan happily provides.
Not every cute movie about the mentally ill is Oscar worthy, but this touching and riotous one from Down Under works well enough.
Collette anchors the film with a selfless, let-it-all-hang-out performance that sets an agreeably anarchic tone.
