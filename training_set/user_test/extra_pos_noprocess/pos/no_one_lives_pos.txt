Darkly funny, creepy, and just downright spectacular...
Home invasion/slasher stuff that has a nasty attitude and a speedy demeanor.
Even though it's played dead straight, this gonzo horror film is so extreme that it's actually quite funny. Whether this is intentional or not is anyone's guess.
Splashes of gore and evisceration combine with a nicely nasty psycho-killer turn from Luke Evans to enliven this grindy slasher from Midnight Meat Train director Ryuhei Kitamura.
A gleefully trashy, darkly funny exploitation horror-slash-thriller with inventive gore scenes, a knowing script and an intriguing central performance from Luke Evans.
Like black pudding, No One Lives is an acquired taste.
Clearly designed to be as grisly as humanly possible, this movie combines a brutal central character with a very flimsy premise.
