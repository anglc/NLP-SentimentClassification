A slow, banjo-string-tight thriller ... Bodies gets under your skin and stays there.
This Sundance-sanctioned, love-on-the-run melodrama is indie filmmaking of a deliberately timeless sort.
A lyrical modern Western that casts a contemporary but un-jaded eye on the romantic mythology of outlaw couples.
Lowery has a lyrical style of storytelling that is delicate and subtle yet suffused with emotion and atmosphere. It's gentle and pointed at the same time.
It is not a large film. But Lowery may well be a large talent, and he sure knows how to cast the right actors.
The [film's beauty] is not just in the incredible cinematography ... but in the way the film holds back information, blindsiding you with tiny revelations.
David Lowery's richly woven, beautifully photographed Ain't Them Bodies Saints wears its dramatic sincerity on its sleeve.
Anchored by two strong performances from Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara.
An honest tale of love and desperation from a couple making ends meet, Ain't Them Bodies Saints might just have been Lowery's audition for the big leagues. And he nailed it.
This is a story about inevitable consequences, fate, predestination, a striving against insurmountable odds. This the kind of story that critics love, but many in the audience might find it a bit depressing.
Rapturously shot but ponderous crime Southern-set drama.
Like a bastard love child of Terrence Malick and Robert Altman, David Lowery's crime drama shuffles to its own drummer.
There are real virtues to this movie; it's remarkably well crafted and beautifully shot (by Bradford Young). If it drifts a little too much toward romanticizing its tender outlaws, it's just following in the footsteps of the masters.
With a dark, storybook mood set firmly in the mode of Terrence Malick's Badlands, or perhaps even Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James, Lowery flips the Bonnie & Clyde paradigm on its ear.
Armed with blistering performances, an engaging narrative and some stunning cinematography and direction, it may very well end up being one of the best of the year
The well-acted film is rich in visual texture and subtle details, and its deliberate pace rewards viewer patience.
Lyrical reverie of all feeling and no action.
A Bonnie & Clyde-informed tale of passion amid the criminal class, it's a film of considerable visual beauty, even lyricism.
Even during its moments of unapologetic pastiche, David Lowery's Ain't Them Bodies Saints is an absorbing drama, nuanced and emotionally evocative.
The film has a dreamlike tone that's very, very sleepy. But it's also haunting and darkly moving.
Not perfect and its dense quality isn't for everyone, but for the things it does right, and the performances it elicits, it's still special.
