The cumulative emotional effect is devastating: the final scenes are as angry, as memorable, as overwhelming as anything modern cinema has to offer.
So overpowering is this film's simple, horrible, and almost entirely true story that it's hard to get enough distance on 12 Years a Slave to poke at its inner workings.
Every scene of 12 Years a Slave, and almost every shot, conveys some penetrating truth about America's original sin.
The power of McQueen's movie is in its declaratory style: This happened. That is all, and that is everything.
It is a film that necessity and education demand seeing.
It provokes recognition in us of the very heart of darkness. It makes the unimaginable imaginable.
As with Schindler's List, you won't want to be munching a bucket of popcorn through this.
Screenwriter John Ridley takes a story that's episodic in nature and crafts a narrative that manages to build in intensity and emotion for over two hours.
Driven by the best performances of the year, bold directing, and a compelling true story that reminds us of our nation's shameful, inhumane past, it is a film destined to enjoy a reputation as one of the greatest films ever produced about slavery.
This isn't simply an important movie, but a dose of brutal truth that must be confronted, and done so with absolute certainty.
Lupita Nyong'o is the emotional epicenter of the entire film.
Ejiofor's low-key, naturalistic acting mode is ideal for conveying Northup's self-control and intelligence. And Fassbender avoids turning the malevolent Epps into a one-note nemesis.
McQueen works from ferocity to felicity. Scenes of body horror bear higher emotional stakes than your average horror film. It's a film of few kindnesses and many graces.
An uncompromising look at slavery in the Antebellum South. Anchored by career-defining performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o, director Steve McQueen brings his assured directorial mind to a harrowing, but necessary picture.
There are no false pretenses or unnecessary charging, instead, there is patience and time. The moments of suspension often become the biggest delight.
Much of it is difficult to watch, but '12 Years a Slave' is that rare film that's both important in its message and a darned good film all the same.
While the praise for 12 Years a Slave has been rather overblown, it's still a recommendable film due to its incredible cast, which helps cover up its weaknesses.
This is a truly impressive piece of filmmaking.
