This is an uncommonly absorbing movie.
We get the predictable plot points - storms, sharks, close calls with passing ships - but it feels like a uniquely handmade artifact.
All Is Lost is very much Redford's triumph. His turn isn't pure disappearance so much as a brilliantly human example of cresting and plummeting, cresting and plummeting.
The movie is rigorous, serious and well-crafted, with Redford holding the screen using only his economical emotional reactions and physical presence.
Frank G. DeMarco and Peter Zuccarini, dual cinematographers, gather gorgeous imagery especially those captured from beneath the ocean's surface.
Chandor never overplays his hand, and in doing so he creates a worthy portrait of a man in a dire situation that resonates with us all.
once Robert Redford is on screen, his muted, exasperated, hopeful performance is an exemplar of the physical. Our Man seems a man of reckless wealth and expansive estrangement: why is he at sea? Begging the larger question, why are we all at sea?
A commanding performance by Robert Redford with nary a word spoken. It makes up for the somewhat tedious running time.
Superb, a brilliantly conceived, first-person masterpiece, totally immersive and compelling from first frame to last. It's easily one of the best survival films ever made, even with Gravity dominating everybody's praise.
