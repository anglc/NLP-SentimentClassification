Unusual Western, with eerie, sinister atmosphere, lots of political commentary, and strange relationships.
Above average western covering the Quantrill territory, full of fiction over fact, and starring John Wayne and Roy Rogers.
Nominated for the Interior Decoration and Score Oscars, this John Wayne pre-Civil War adventure is better than the norm due to Raoul Walsh's direction and good cast.
Republic's costliest film; it was also its biggest box office hit.
