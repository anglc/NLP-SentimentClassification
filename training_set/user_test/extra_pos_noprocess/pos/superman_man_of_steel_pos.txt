There's plenty to like in Snyder's hectic, rowdy film. But by the time we reach the bludgeoning excesses of the last half-hour it's hard to shake the sense that this was an opportunity at least partially missed.
The movie delivers on the promise of its title and then some.
...while it doesn't achieve the brilliance of the modern Batman franchise, and while it certainly has a few flaws... the action is undeniably well-done and there are still good character bits throughout.
Despite its excessive running time, and slightly meandering narrative, Man of Steel has definitely earned its place amongst recent comic-book adaptations, standing tall in the DC / Marvel cinematic universe.
Action-packed, briskly-paced and featuring a stellar cast, Man of Steel is the best Superman film since the 1978 original and proves DC can match Marvel in the massive scale department.
[Zach] Snyder who made his mark with the film 300 can manipulate images but fails to bring them to life.
A definite step-up from the last attempt to revive this character, but there's something still missing from this origin story. Other franchise builders have done more with less, but here that isn't for lack of trying.
Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is a gritty and realistic take on one of the most iconic superheroes ever. It's visually astonishing and action-packed.
MAN OF STEEL is everything you've ever wanted in a Superman movie
