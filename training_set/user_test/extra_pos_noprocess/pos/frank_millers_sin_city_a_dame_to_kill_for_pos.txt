A Dame To Kill For isn't likely to create converts out of those uninterested in the pulpy side of fiction. But it more than earns its keep in terms of lavishing love, mildly ironic as well as pretty damn earnest, on pumped-up noir.
For those who appreciated Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's 2005 campy, kinetic film noir homage, Sin City, the 2014 follow-up, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is unlikely to disappoint.
Unfortunately - very unfortunately - A Dame To Kill For offers nothing new and feels terribly, sadly, redundant.
While it might not feel as complete and well-rounded as the first movie, Sin City: A Dame To Kill For is a worthily prurient follow-up that offers up a whole bundle of new cinematic tricks, and a rogue's gallery of exciting new characters.
While it's not the mind-blowing event that the first film was, there's still enjoyment to be had, and Eva Green makes anything she stars in a must see.
The mood is dry as gunpowder - and as explosive
The stylistic brilliance of the Sin City sequel is much the same as its forerunner in 2005 - an explosive interpretation of Frank Miller's graphic novels in which dames are curvaceous temptresses and men are killing machines at the ready
On the whole this is an impressive, complementary second trip.
