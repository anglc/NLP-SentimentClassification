Larger-than-life movie in the best sense, a veritable feast for all senses from a truly singular cinematic voice that always demands attention and respect.
A visually opulent, proudly melodramatic entertainer with some great songs and star performances.
A riot of colour, dance, music and mayhem, the film is so compelling you daren't take your eyes off the screen for a second, and yet at moments it's so overwhelming you yearn for some respite.
