Van Damme makes for a highly entertaining villain in this briskly paced B-movie.
Mr. Hyams keeps things moving briskly, building to an ending with a pretty good plot twist.
Enemies Closer belongs to a category of old-school action movies usually associated with the direct-to-video market: lean, brisk, and distinguished by a clean visual style and an emphasis on practical stuntwork over effects.
A silly yet sturdily crafted time-filler ...
Enemies Closer is the first collaboration between Peter Hyams and Jean-Claude Van Damme since 1995's Sudden Death. The reunion feels long overdue.
If you don't expect anything groundbreaking or dramatically dynamic, you'll probably have just as much fun watching Enemies Closer as Van Damme, playing a total fruitcake of a villain, clearly did making it.
Outrageous, unintentionally funny, cartoonish, dumb and consistently entertaining---in other words: the ultimate B-movie that's best watched at midnight with a group of friends while intoxicated.
An agreeable way to kill 80 minutes.
Van Damme's English is less intelligible than usual, and his line readings are sluggish in places. Improbably enough, this adds to the performance ...
A reasonably engaging B-movie, benefiting from Van Damme's nutty performance and Hyams's dedication to cinematic economy. Surprises are few, outside of the eye-roll count, which is unexpectedly low.
