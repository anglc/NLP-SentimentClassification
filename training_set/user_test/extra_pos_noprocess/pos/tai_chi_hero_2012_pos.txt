Surprisingly heartbreaking at times, Tai Chi Hero adds some much needed depth to an already well-established and vividly distinguishable action franchise.
The second installment in a planned martial-arts trilogy mixes broad comedy and cartoonish action that will appeal to the genre's fans, though crossover potential seems limited.
Tai Chi Hero is a kung fu mashup, sticking steam-powered airplanes made of Victorian-age gewgaws and metal gears into one of those martial arts films where people float through the air without benefit of any flying machines at all.
Like its predecessor, Tai Chi Hero is continually hampered by its thin characters and badly convoluted narrative but at least this time there are more opportunities to savour the many oddball pleasures.
