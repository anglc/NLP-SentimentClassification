[It] isn't just the most atmospheric and scary Chucky film, it's one of the most confident and successful American horror movies of the 2010s.
By grounding the film in a haunted house-style horror movie and making Chucky a creepy doll again, while still maintaining the warped humor that the first three films had, it may deliver the best film in the franchise.
There's something to be said for going back to old-school scares once the self-mocking silliness dries up.
The Child's Play franchise...makes a surprising, successful reversal with Curse Of Chucky, the franchise's serious-minded, at times even dour fifth sequel.
Serves as a really good and entertaining book end for the end of the series...
After nine years, Chucky is finally back in his proper element, and that's reason enough for any horror fan to rejoice.
Curse Of Chucky is a vicious return to form for one of horror's most legendary icons, terrorizing victims in the purest, darkest form of criminal insanity.
Curse of Chucky is nicely restrained, eking out suspense and building characters before all voodoo hell breaks loose.
A morbidly witty schlocker.
the film, unfolding for the most part in a veritable doll's house, is certainly a stylishly twisted unpeeling of its antagonist's strange history.
This may be nothing more than a low-budget horror sequel, yet it is one that is much better than the straight-to-video label would lead you to believe.
'Curse of Chucky' [is] alarmingly good...Chucky fans should rejoice as [it] is clearly going to re-ignite the franchise for years to come. Chucky has never looked better...
