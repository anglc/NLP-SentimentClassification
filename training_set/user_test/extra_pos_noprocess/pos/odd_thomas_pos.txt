Odd Thomas is an engagingly lightweight and occasionally visually inventive film that should appeal to Koontz fans and anyone else open to his whimsical approach to horror.
An endearing, witty romantic dramedy-slash-supernatural-thriller about a small desert town in California beset by demonic apparitions and a satanic cabal of deranged would-be mass murderers.
...easily stands as Sommers' most accomplished work to date.
Even if "Off Thomas" would have likely had a more fruitful life on the small screen, it is still an enjoyably fast-paced way to spend 96 minutesÂ—with a few additional surprises up its sleeve.
The best combination of scares, comedy, romance, eye-popping special effects and good ol' sass since 1990's "Ghost." At any rate, its a lot better than 1996's "The Frighteners."
After Van Helsing, the first G.I. Joe and the Mummy movies, filmmaker Stephen Sommers just about keeps his excessive action instincts in check for this offbeat supernatural comedy.
captures the feel and essence of Dean Koontz's writing
Odd Thomas is a much better film than it's non-release would suggest. Hopefully one day it'll find it's audience and people will appreciate it for something other than just being better than Phantoms.
