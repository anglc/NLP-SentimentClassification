It's all thoroughly, intentionally lightweight, and the film's final 10 minutes is a rush of highly unlikely smiley face resolutions. Still, Wood somehow makes it work as well as it can.
Barefoot follows an expected Pretty Woman-esque path, but it's quite charming along the way, and the oddball premise helps it feel fresh.
While I am aware of the flaws in Barefoot... and sensitive to the obvious holes in the script, I still enjoyed the film, thanks largely to the charms of its two leads: Evan Rachel Wood and Scott Speedman.
