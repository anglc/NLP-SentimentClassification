Having taken the flood out of time, Morrison plants it firmly in space - or as firm as any dreamscape can be. He's made a sort of travelog, and it's destination is inundation.
Somehow it feels wrong to enjoy a story about so much suffering.
Destined for a long life in museums and history classes alike, this is cinema as art, and a classic.
Most of all it's a unique, highly immersing audio-visual experience that would be as at home in a museum as it is in a movie theater - and that's a first-order compliment.
The movie on its own would have been nice, but with this music it's sublime.
A striking experiment in music and moviemaking.
The damage gives the images an appropriately mud-spattered, post-disaster appearance; sometimes the splotchy, jumpy degradation transforms these smalltown flood scenes into abstract animated splatter paintings.
The footage itself isn't always well-preserved but director Bill Morrison incorporates it into the overall effect.
Brief title cards orient the viewer to the history, but the moving combination of sound and image ends up being more profound than any explanatory narration could ever be.
The Great Flood works as a wordless narrative of human endurance.
Even in comparatively conventional mode, Bill Morrison's work still benefits from the poetic potential of nature's repossession of its own elements.
