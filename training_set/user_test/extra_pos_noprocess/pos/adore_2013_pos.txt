Would Fontaine have made this film if the mothers looked like and were as old as Barbra Streisand and Kathy Bates and the sons weren't built like surfers? Of course not.
Adore is, as my late mother would say in describing Sidney Sheldon novels, good trash.
There's more depth and feeling to the admittedly provocative premise of this twisted sexual drama than you might expect...It's the excoriating payoff to the story that makes Adoration a cautionary tale with a major sting.
Viewed again, far from the madding crowd and general hoo-ha of Sundance, it stands up much better than expected.
Watchable soapy melodrama enlivened by gorgeous photography and strong performances from all four leads ...
Sets the bar pretty low, and achieves its goal.
'Adore' has received mostly negative reviews. The dismissiveness suggests a discomfort with the subject matter -- an unwillingness to process this particular fiction by writers who on other days grapple agreeably with haunted houses and singing chipmunks.
Despite the Australian surf-community setting, the film has a refreshingly grown-up European sensibility.
