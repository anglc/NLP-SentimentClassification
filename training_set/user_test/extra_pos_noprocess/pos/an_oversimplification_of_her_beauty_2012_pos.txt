Bold and varied animation sequences lift this into the stratosphere before it falls back into Nance's obsessively layered narrative; the resulting film is both beautiful and disorienting (just like love).
While the movie doesn't paint a clear sense of Nance's emotional side, one thing is certain: He is an artist with creativity to spare. This effort may not have been wholly successful, but it's a promising start to what could be a thrilling career.
It is an emotionally exhausting but ultimately rewarding kaleidoscope of video, animation, words and music - and feelings on top of feelings on top of feelings.
The excess and earnestness suit the subject - the ephemeral and all-consuming nature of romantic love.
What saves the film-and grandly-is Nance's wildly ambitious visual imagination.
A dense, organic, dazzling and funny tapestry, making use of varied and subtly colored animation and stop-motion; candid video; playfully verbose direct address; chapters and footnotes and doodles; and suavely chosen music and sonic bridges.
Nance dissects himself with candour and self-deprecating charm, ensuring that beneath the experimentation this is deeply relatable.
Mind-boggling fare indeed.
Hyperbolic adjectives such as dizzying, effervescent, kaleidoscopic and exhilarating spring to mind but don't adequately convey the craft and persistence that have gone into this confessional slice of (semi) non-fiction.
Those who don't often delve into the avant-garde and left-field film-making may struggle to warm to this atypical love story but there's no denying Nance has a distinctive voice.
Even without any proper dramatic scenes, this swirling collage of a movie draws us into its story and situations, revealing deep truths about relationships.
An Oversimplification of Her Beauty is a love story, and it appropriately feels as if it has been made with the heart more than the head.
The film is annoying at times, hugely inventive at others. The animation sequences are cult-collectable.
Writer-director-actor Terence Nance's feature debut is a stylistically bold, original and deeply introspective drama-slash documentary that puts an intriguing arthouse spin on the standard romcom template.
Garrulous and a little pretentious, but also sweet, and astute enough to allow the dream girl a right of reply.
Terence Nance's debut feature and festival favorite, An Oversimplification of Her Beauty, is anything but.
An artistic but unpretentious examination of young love, with all its uncertainties and mini-tragedies.
