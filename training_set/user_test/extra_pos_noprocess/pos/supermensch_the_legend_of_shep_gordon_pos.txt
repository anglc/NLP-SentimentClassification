Slickly directed by actor Mike Myers, it intersperses Gordon's sunny reminiscences with testimony from an army of A-list clients and celebrity pals. Admittedly, there are great stories here.
Yes, there is some gravity in the film, but mostly it's the rock-and-roll story of a rock-and-roll life (even though one of his favorite clients was Canadian folk singer Anne Murray).
How can you not love this guy, this story?
For all the love emanating from client-pals Michael Douglas, Sylvester Stallone, Emeril Lagasse, and Steven Tyler, there's a sadness to this movie that remains just off camera.
Mike Myers makes his directorial debut by chronicling the fascinating life of one of Hollywood's most fabled raconteurs and charismatic talent managers.
You may not have heard of this Hollywood legend, but you definitely know a few of his famous friends.
The absurdly-paraphrased version of the story we come away with is that Gordon is the nicest guy to ever have worked in Hollywood and that good things happen to good people.
He's splendidly charismatic company, as his A-list roster attests en masse.
What could have been a very gooey, toe-curling exercise in self-congratulation is lifted by Shep Gordon himself.
We shouldn't be surprised that this is a love letter to a chum. Nor should we be surprised that one of the great masters of PR emerges smelling of roses.
It is inevitably fondly offered and soft-centred but SuperMensch is still an entertaining journey through a pretty remarkable life.
It makes for a lively, entertaining guide to the LA music scene in the 70s and 80s and the film business - Gordon dabbled in movie production.
It might veer towards hagiography at times, but its subject is so entertaining you don't even care.
You'll be looking him up as soon as it ends. The feeling this is all some huge elaborate hoax only adds spice!
No doubt, he is a great entertainer in his own right. Still, this one is strictly for showbiz buffs and Alice Cooper fans.
More sugar-rush than Sugarman, but Gordon's extraordinary life just outside the spotlight is a whirlwind of charm and chutzpah.
The obvious affection Myers feels for his subject is extremely touching, though you do wonder just how full a picture you're getting as a result.
We should probably expect more doc profiles of prominent talent agents who are really warm, wonderful human beings. Brace yourselves.
Fun, fascinating, but a fawning documentary that avoids asking the tough questions or making the harsh judgements.
A breezy, riveting sit, sold with humor and passable candor as this nobody who was actually somebody becomes known by everybody.
Hollywood insider Shep Gordon is a raconteur and an all-around great guy, according to him and Myers, who directed a documentary about his pal.
