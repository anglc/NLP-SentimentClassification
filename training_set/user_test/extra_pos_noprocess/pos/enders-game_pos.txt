While the picture loses some plot tension by assuring the viewer that Ender is basically an okay kid, it gains by showing the growth of the boy into his destiny as "the One."
Straightforward, a bit literal-minded, very faithful to the book and largely compelling.
There are times when a certain grimness weighs on the movie that you wish for more humor. But overall it's an absorbing and thought-provoking spectacle.
An engaging and exciting sci-fi flick to bring out the 12-year-old in all of us.
Although it's far from perfect and it's in need of a few tune-ups, Ender's Game does lay the groundwork for what could be a satisfying saga.
