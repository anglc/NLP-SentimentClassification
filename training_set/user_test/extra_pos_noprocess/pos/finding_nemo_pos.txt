The latest flood of wizardry from Pixar, whose productions, from Toy Story onward, have lent an indispensable vigor and wit to the sagging art of mainstream animation.
Finding Nemo is laced with smart humor and clever gags, and buoyed by another cheery story of mismatched buddies: a pair of fish voiced by Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres.
Like Pixar's previous films, Finding Nemo mines humor from the oddities of an unknown world but stays grounded in a familiar one, finding recognizable elements of heartbreak and happiness amid the ink-jetting octopi and irritable flounders.
While Mr. Brooks is very funny, Ms. DeGeneres gives a bravura comic performance, as well as a touching one.
A genuinely funny and touching film that, in less than a decade, has established itself as a timeless classic.
A timeless delight.
Pixar's fourth feature for Disney is yet another miracle of computer animation, an instant classic, but with less of the surface brightness of Toy Story or Monsters, Inc.
Pixar continued its run of superb computer-generated animated features with this jaw-dropping underwater adventure.
[Dory's] throwaway lines are funnier than anything that comes out of all the other fish combined, balancing out the dull father-son-must-be-reunited story at the core of Nemo that threatens to make this just another cartoon.
The animation is so sleek and the action so perfectly paced that even the sharpest viewer could be forgiven for overlooking some unimportant lapses in internal logic.
It looks more stunning than ever.
An Easter treat.
This is a classic - bring on the sequel!
Every frond and fin pokes out at you.
Re-releasing Nemo in 3D gives a whole new generation the chance to enjoy it in cinemas for the first time - as well as adding extra depth to the wonderful scenes from the ocean deep.
Though some scary parts may make the very young fret unduly, the film also puts forward some thoughtful messages for both children and their parents. [Blu-ray 3D]
Detail is what holds your attention from frame to frame: the panorama of soft and hard corals, the different textured sea bottoms, the undulating seaweed, and the schooling sardines that look flashy and real as can be.
I don't exactly worship Pixar, but "Finding Nemo" is truly a great film.
Gill is Platoon's Sgt. Elias if he'd survived Sgt. Barnes' treachery and returned to civilian life weary and hard-bitten from his experiences. And also a fish.
Finding Nemo 3D is a quality post-conversion experience that successfully enhances the 2003 film's original standout visuals.
The 3D gives the images a little more depth but they already had heft and weight. The 3D is a money-making gimmick, nothing more.
A great blend of storytelling and technology.
