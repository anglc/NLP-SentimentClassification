You get a strong whiff of what it must have been like to be Johnny Cash, or his exasperated manager, from this film. It would make a good companion piece to "Walk the Line.
Despite the clunky mix of narrative formats, "My Father and the Man in Black" makes for an illuminating alternate history of sorts to the Hollywoodized version of Cash's ascendancy in "Walk the Line."
Partly transcends its inherent self-indulgence.
It's certainly a more enlightening look than any big-budget Hollywood biopic could offer.
A strong story without the reconstructions. . . son/director could have trusted the powerful audio-visual material. . . instead of overplaying the reenactments and narration.
This has the potential to be dreadfully maudlin stuff, but the film is too damn interesting to be maudlin.
For Cash devotees who want a hitherto-hidden perspective on their man ... this is invaluable viewing.
Plays like a non-fiction Walk the Line with script input by Eugene O'Neill.
It's fascinating to look at the life of Johnny Cash from a new angle, even if this documentary feels somewhat self-indulgent and a bit amateurish.
Incredibly eye-opening and extraordinary thanks to endearingly personal accounts and strong archival footage.
Slightly jerry-built reconstructions detract from an intriguing film with a unique angle on the country legend.
