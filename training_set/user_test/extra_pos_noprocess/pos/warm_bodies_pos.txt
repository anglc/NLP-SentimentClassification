This is a love story, done with charm, humor, and tenderness.
It's all very silly and sweet in that indie-nostalgic way that Levine ('The Wackness' and '50/50') has made his own.
This is a bloody fresh twist on the zombie genre.
To truly appreciate this zombie Romeo & Juliet you either go all the way with it or not at all.
It's a toss-up which genre more needs the adrenaline boost Warm Bodies provides: the zombie movie or the romantic comedy.
Warm Bodies proves a movie can have a lot of heart even when the heart of one of the characters isn't beating.
Warm Bodies is an ingenious hybrid that, at its best, manages to be funny, lyrical and gruesome.
The film does win you over. This is largely in part to its pair of young actors, Hoult and Palmer, who and have a great deal of chemistry and inject a zip and a fizz into all of their scenes.
Warm Bodies goes straight on to my guilty-pleasures list.
Let's be clear: This is a popcorn flick. The CGI effects are laughable, and it takes a while to adjust to the willfully cheeseball tone, but once it clicks, it's irresistible. In this world, all you need is love. And sometimes a shotgun.
This is such a well-written, well-acted, and well-paced film with a great payoff at the end that it proves that "adorable" and "zombie movie" are capable of coexisting together.
mixes a unique style with a talented young cast to create a grizzly but likeable treat
A strong ending can hide a multitude of sins, and Warm Bodies is perhaps the only zombie movie I've seen that sent me out of the theater feeling happy
A surprisingly-funny zombie film boasting a killer soundtrack and a great script.
It's a zombie movie that's the opposite of a zombie movie, which is a reason to sorta love it.
while Levine's film may distinguish itself both as genre flick and romance, there are problems in its writing that no amount of unnatural love can quite cure.
Warm Bodies is a charming, fresh and always funny "zom-com" with a lot of heart, thanks to director Jonathan Levine's ability to explore love in the most unexpected of places.
As one might expect from a zombie romance, the film doesn't pack a lot of big ideas. Still, the concept is original, and watching it unfold is loads of fun.
A reasonably diverting blend of horror, comedy and romance
