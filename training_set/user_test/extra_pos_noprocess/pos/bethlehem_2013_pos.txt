Bethlehem's plot is nothing new; it's the oft-told Cain and Abel story updated for the age of suicide bombers and tactical strikes, as a tautly structured mix of melodrama and ticking-clock thriller.
Cinematographer Yaron Scharf shoots Bethlehem like a modern western, every grimace, twitch and drop of sweat playing in stark relief against an implacable landscape that has seen much spilled blood.
The politics of "Bethlehem" are complex, but the relationship at its heart is simple: a kid who needs some kind of stability in his life, even if it comes from a most unlikely, and dangerous, place.
A rich, multilayered character study cleverly garbed as an action thriller, Bethlehem is a searing critique of the conflict and its toll - not just in human lives, but also in two peoples' gradual, overall loss of humanity.
Bethlehem remains a fairly powerful experience because so much of what we see is inflamed by a violence that seems to have no end.
The story of a young Palestinian, pushed into informing by the Israeli secret police, and forced to navigate conflicting feelings of loyalty, betrayal, self-interest and revenge.
The moral murkiness of the Israel-Palestine conflict sets the scene for a blistering espionage thriller.
In the light of what has been happening in nearby Gaza, this small but memorable film assumes an even greater impact.
Its most compelling element, however, is the relationship between informer and informant.
Bethlehem negotiates a tangle of loyalties that's as complex as the Middle East itself.
[The similar] 'Omar,' a recent Oscar nominee, is better directed, with assured long takes by an established talent, Hany Abu-Assad ('Paradise Now'). 'Bethlehem' has the better, cleaner script, and the best performance of the two.
Extremely suspenseful, with a terse screenplay.
Might not offer new insights into a terrible conflict, but it depicts its human cost on the ground with often starling power.
As it is, it's a strong and eye-catching debut, but one that doesn't quite mark its ground as the next big thing in Israeli cinema.
A harrowing account of how many lives can be ruined when hatred is allowed to rule.
Bethlehem never really comes together as a revelatory experience until an incredible, wince-inducingly savage finale that leaves a strong aftertaste.
In a spy story, Bethlehem insists, there are no good guys or bad guys, and no victor-just day-in, day-out deceit and betrayal, the weary work of hate.
