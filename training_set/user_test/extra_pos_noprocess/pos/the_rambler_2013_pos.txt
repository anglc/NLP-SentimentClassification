I can't say I understand Calvin Lee Reeder's intentions concerning The Rambler, but since there's plenty of room for interpretation, I found my own meaning amongst this wacky mess of mummies and red wine.
Sinister, comical, aggravating, and audacious, Calvin Lee Reeder's film is nothing short of an affront.
Feels like a distant cousin to the new Maniac remake: horror stories told from inside the mind of a calm, cool lunatic.
A mixture of unhinged brilliance, idiocy, unsettling confusion, and a whole lot of chaos.
