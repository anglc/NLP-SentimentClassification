As in their previous comedies, Pegg and Frost play men who refuse to stop acting like boys. But these pint-swilling Peter Pans also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs.
If Wright doesn't quite sustain this astonishing mixture of sadness and silliness all the way through, he gets major points just for attempting it in the first place.
The gonzo side of the plot is not quite as engaging as the human drama, and the scenes in which the characters meet up and try to mesh again are some of the best in the film.
Wright & Pegg continue making the sort of films that the 12-year-old versions of themselves probably always dreamed of being a part of; that sense of joy and practically disbelief that they actually get to do this for a living is right up there on-screen.
The film's strength is its comedic bent - there are some very funny moments contained herein.
Robert Frost famously mused 'Some say the world will end in fire/Some say in ice.' I prefer Edgar Wright's vision: It will end in a pub.
While it also suffers from a slow start and stretched premise, the charm of its stars getting wasted and debunking an intergalactic conspiracy goes a long way.
Maybe it is time to move on from the genre mash-up, but this is a thundering way to go out.
A movie that will unexpectedly challenge your expectations in some of the funniest ways you can imagine.
It's fine in its way, a fond and silly salute to pub crawls, old friends, crap cars, roundabouts, British eccentricity and keeping your head in a crisis -- it's just terribly hit-and-miss.
It's high old fun, though it plays as a bit too much of a rehash of Pegg and Wright's Shaun of the Dead.
Wright is one of the most original and energetic filmmakers out there, and paired with Pegg and Frost's expert rapport and a highly charismatic cast, there is no limit to what the team can tackle.
Wright uses what he learned on Scott Pilgrim to further his long-standing ability to craft genre comedies that are adept at both the comedic aspects and capturing the crowd-pleasing conventions of the genre with which the comedy is combined.
The World's Ends ultimately succeeds where its protagonists fail, proving it's possible to grow up without getting old.
Director Edgar Wright is as brilliant as ever...
Retaining the hilarious chaos and offhand hipness expected of Mssrs. Wright, Pegg and Frost, The World's End doesn't quite spark with Shaun of the Dead's audacious freshness, but is great fun and a definite improvement over the fizz-free Hot Fuzz.
You might want to have a beer after you see 'The World's End,' the latest from the creative team of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright.
To me, it is not quite up to the level of their previous films ('Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz') but it is still good enough to recommend.
Let's hope this crew from the UK continues to stand up against the Starbucking of movies.
I'd estimate that 75% of The World's End is enjoyable. The other 25% isn't bad, just repetitive.
