After fearlessly diving into a character that's self-centered, wretched, and downright degrading, Quaid outdoes most of his earlier works of cinema.
Tough, engaging, and brutally honest, At Any Price is one of those quiet gems you hope others will have the opportunity to discover for themselves.
...feels like a great American tragedy, like East of Eden or Death of a Salesman. There's ... a fidelity to the way things actually work themselves out in the real world, in compromise and half-measures and moral doubt.
Though Bahrani may be moving toward the mainstream here, he remains an empathetic, nuanced chronicler of the American working class.
At Any Price isn't so much about race cars or corn as it is about what price we're willing to pay to protect what we love, and to keep our hopes and dreams alive. As such it's a fitting parable for our times.
As is implicit in the title, the destructiveness of competition is a rippling concern in Bahrani and co-writer Hallie Elizabeth Newton's unpredictably expansive script.
At its heart, the film is a small-scale story about two men learning how to fix their mistakes -- or, if that isn't possible, to live with them.
A thought-provoking and original drama that takes an intriguing look at the competitive nature of the agricultural industry.
Bahrani's evocation of place and culture is utterly convincing, even if his story seems to have gone before the cameras before it was quite ripe.
... sporadically compelling drama, a lack-of-character study trashy enough for fun and thoughtful enough to be taken seriously.
