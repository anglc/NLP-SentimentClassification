[Something] in Tammy you wouldn't expect to see in a mainstream comedy [is] the romantic pairing of McCarthy with indie heartthrob Mark Duplass, reversing the formula of the male slob who gets the conventionally beautiful girl.
Co-written by star McCarthy with her director (and real life husband) Falcone, "Tammy" is a dramadey that actually works best during its most serious moments.
... Tammy is Melissa McCarthy at her best, frank and raw but in a much more honest way than we've seen before.
Susan Sarandon is terrific; delivering a superb and shaded turn for what could have been a broad "rude grandma" phone-in.
While there is little in the way of plot, "Tammy" is more character-based than the typical summer comedy, and it's held up by strong performances by McCarthy and a very game Sarandon.
Tammy forgoes cheap laughs in favor of heart.
