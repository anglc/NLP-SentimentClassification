Once Mr. Bong sets his monorail in motion the movie assumes an irresistible momentum, accelerated by nonstop mayhem, gallows humor and an immersive visual style that possesses a heady sense of the steam-punk Apocalypse.
This is powerful stuff, and all the more so for its straightforwardness.
There's a righteous savagery to this movie that's almost but not quite obscured by the lushness of its imagined world.
It's so hard to describe how amazing Snowpiercer is without giving away everything that makes it amazing.
You couldn't ask for a better metaphor for hell on Earth than what Bong Joon-ho has wrought with Snowpiercer: constant forward momentum while getting absolutely nowhere, suffering all the while.
Overall, this is a solid, distinctive and sometimes exquisitely inspired thriller-and-beyond.
It's a wicked, violent parable, and one of the only movies of the summer worth talking about after the credits roll.
It's literally a hell of a ride -- Brazil meets Murder on the Orient Express.
A cool summer movie full of action, suspense, moral ambiguities, cryptic clues and villains who just won't die.
I enjoyed every bonkers, goofy, cartoonish, creative moment of Snowpiercer.
It's the most inventive science-fiction picture in years, the most original action film in a decade and perhaps the most all-around entertaining movie so far this year.
There's no easy way to pigeonhole this English-language movie from Korean writer-director Joon-ho Bong, except to say that it's a true original.
Snowpiercer is a compelling, unsettling thrill ride that's well worth the wait.
In just one scene of Snowpiercer, [Chris Evans] gets to act more than in all his Captain America films combined.
The setup may be high-concept times a thousand, but the obviousness of the symbolism is so inextricably interwoven with the forward momentum of the plot and so well complemented by Joon-ho's comic-book style and sick humor, you can't help but buy in.
Bong Joon-ho's movie is a gripping, thrilling, utterly credible adventure.
Snowpiercer's ultimate victory is how palatable it makes its unbelievably weird material.
Snowpiercer is an engaging experience and is not only the most assured and interesting film of the recent Korean new-wavers' Hollywood output, but it's also a riveting action blockbuster in itself, the best of the American summer thus far.
In a world full of Divergents and Hunger Games and 2012s, Snowpiercer not only has the confidence to ask difficult questions -- it also has the courage make the viewer answer them for his or herself.
This is a dark, but deeply beautiful movie, punctuated by edge-of-your-seat thrills and unexpected laughs.
