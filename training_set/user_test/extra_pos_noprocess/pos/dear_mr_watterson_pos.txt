An hour and a half of hero worship, basically. Fine by me.
If you're a fan of Calvin and Hobbes, director Joel Allen Schroeder's documentary Dear Mr. Watterson is more or less pure joy.
If nothing else, it's a pleasant reminder that if you haven't taken those Calvin & Hobbes anthologies off the shelf in a while, maybe it's time to go exploring again.
A very worthwhile address of the art and industry of comic strips as a whole. Schroeder has a great appreciation for what his expert interviewees have to say.
A charming look at the world of Calvin and Hobbes.
An affectionate and personable look at the effect of one man's work on others that doesn't say much beyond that.
A fantastic love letter to Calvin and Hobbes and its fans...
(D)epending on how much you adore Calvin and Hobbes as both a creation and a comic, Dear Mr. Watterson will either be a disappointment or a discovery.
...the 90-minute documentary doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is: a love letter to a great comic, providing a digestible version of its history with an eye to its legacy.
The movie definitely makes you want to read, or re-read, these classics.
The term "feel-good documentary" is not often bandied about, but Dear Mr. Watterson is just that.
Whatever one might say about this documentary's excesses, it's the work of some talented filmmakers: The directing, editing, cinematography, music and visual effects all impress.
