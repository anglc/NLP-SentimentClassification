The picture... can't be said to break any new ground in the gritty, mean-streets genre. But it has a better-than-average cast and a few clever plot twists, and it ends up being an occasionally amusing time-killer.
The Power of Few still feels very "independent" and, more importantly, original. Even if its cast is filled with well-known actors, the film embraces risky, unconventional storytelling.
