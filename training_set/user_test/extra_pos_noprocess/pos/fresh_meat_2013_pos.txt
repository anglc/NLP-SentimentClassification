While Fresh Meat is sometimes hard to swallow, I admittedly had more fun than I should have with this cannibal caper.
while Mulheron's film works perfectly well as an over-the-top caper-like cluster***k of clashing values and transgressive tropes, it also has just enough locally sourced meat on the bone to emerge with its own peculiar textures and flavours.
