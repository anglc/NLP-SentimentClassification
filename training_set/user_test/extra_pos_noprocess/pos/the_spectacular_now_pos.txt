[A] nuanced and unsentimental coming-of-age film.
This adaptation of Tim Tharp's novel, directed with delicate restraint by James Ponsoldt, sneaks up on you. It makes you laugh, then it breaks your heart.
Teller and Woodley hum together, and the movie does their performances justice.
This coming-of-age movie should appeal to smart, sensitive young people who haven't been exposed to the better examples of the genre.
The film is engrossing all the way through, the sweetest, saddest, most humane movie I've seen all year.
So many films featuring teens seem overstimulated or familiar. This one strikes a deep, rich note and holds it.
James Ponsoldt's The Spectacular Now is one of the uncommon pieces of teen cinema that rings true.
Every time the film teeters on the precipice of a generic plot point it satisfyingly withdraws into more subtle and nuanced territory that ultimately coalesces in a final act that is sentimental without being sugary.
t's a coming-of-age-slash-first-love story, with beguiling leads, a frank, bittersweet script, a lived-in, rustic setting (the outskirts of Athens, Georgia), an intense awareness of class difference and a mood that's all its own.
The key to The Spectacular Now's success is in its insight, empathy, and fantastic performances.
