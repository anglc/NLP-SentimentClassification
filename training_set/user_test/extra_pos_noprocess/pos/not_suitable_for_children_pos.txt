The premise sounds like a playpen for vulgarity but Michael Lucas's script is smarter than that.
A film with great characters, laughs and earned emotion, Not Suitable isn't a revolutionary film, but it does what most of its romantic ilk doesn't: it actually works.
A heartily welcome sex comedy with a few sneaky surprises.
Performances are impressive - particularly Snook, who seems destined for greatness - with screenwriter Michael Lucas serving a suitably gentle helping of humour throughout.
Breaking down some stereotypes and making you think about a common issue in an uncommon way, this is a smart little flick, with some top acting and fine humour to boot.
Wonderfully bright, smart, honest look at kidulthood...This energetic and extremely well-acted film manages to avoid the cliches that beset most manch-coms.
Despite some contrived plot points (the convenient pay-to-get-in house parties, for one), Not Suitable for Children is more than suitable because it doesn't treat viewers like children.
What lifts this Australian romantic-comedy above the level of most of its Hollywood counterparts is the reality of the characters and the situations and the honesty of the film's approach.
This smart, soulful and surprisingly darkly-hued comedy throws up a handful of interesting questions about personal responsibility.
This is the genre that has made Judd Apatow a 'brand' filmmaker, a contemporary love story with hard edges and patches of vulgar, lowbrow fun. The comparison is meant as a compliment
It's an assured and promising first picture from this writer and director, but if Not Suitable for Children is to be remembered for anything it'll be as the movie that introduced us to Sarah Snook.
The more open-minded viewer...will enjoy a warm, funny, contemporary comedy-drama that will serve the director and, in particular, leading lady Sarah Snook very well.
The film benefits greatly from taking characters and stories down paths you don't expect, but unfortunately this is also the films biggest flaw.
Not Suitable For Children is a refreshingly solid and raw Australian 'dramedy' that delivers poignant characters and relieving laughs while highlighting our fragile and absurdly fleeting existence.
