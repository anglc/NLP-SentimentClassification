A largely enjoyable and credible coming-of-age romp, despite some forced broadness and uneven pacing.
Like a fresh ripple in the near-stagnant high school movie pool, Chris Nelson's "Date and Switch" balances formula with winning performers, genuine humor and a generosity of spirit that this genre too often lacks.
In its sloppy humor and unabashedly earnest expressions of friendship and romance, the movie feels like any likable, and generally forgettable, teen comedy. And yet with its casually handled twist, the genre ambles forward just a little bit.
