The languid pace effectively communicates the characters' crushing boredom, yet the dramatic interest never flags.
While the climax of Beneath the Harvest Sky is a jumble of crosscutting, thunderstorms, and an inconveniently collapsing house, the movie never loses the pulse of people and tragedies it knows too well.
For all its missteps, the film feels authentic. Through thick and thin, it stubbornly maintains a thorny integrity.
Directors Aron Gaudet and Gita Pullapilly are documentarians making their fiction debut, and they pack the movie with seemingly authentic, nitty-gritty details about life in the potato country of far northern Maine.
Gaudet and Pullapilly have a background in documentaries, and there's a convincing naturalism to their storytelling.

Casper and Dominic are modern everymen -- theirs are not at all unique experiences, which is why their story resounds so loudly.
An authentic representation of teenage angst. Beneath the Harvest Sky offers a genuine view of what it's like to grow up in rural poverty.
Their leap from fact to fiction doesn't come without a few stumbles on the way, but Gaudet and Pullapilly effectively symbolize a generation that has one foot on the gas and both eyes closed, and if you can appreciate that, your time will not be wasted.
