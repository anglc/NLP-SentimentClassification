Wasted on the Young's pulsating soundtrack, immediate direction by first time filmmaker Lucas ... and Leanne Cole's hectic editing all lend the film a vibrancy that is sorely lacking in a lot of cinema these days.
A scorching ultra modern morality fable that uses school grounds, party houses and internet connections as stomping grounds for social allegory.
Wasted on the Young is a slick and striking film that presents a disturbingly recognisable world of plutocratic rule in the dark heart of Australian society.
It's very, very strikingly done.
This dramatic tale of that sense of entitlement that some people have to get away with any violation, and revenge via modern media is an absolute winner for me.
I'm not convinced that there's a clear message but this is still a film worth your attention. The editing is sharp and the cinematography is striking.
The film transcends the trappings of a traditional teen parable. It becomes something closer to Rian Johnson's masterful Brick, in which a bunch of film noir archetypes were anachronistically transported into a high school, just for the hell of it.
Stylistically striking and featuring a clutch of stunning performances from emerging local talent, this is a remarkable achievement sure to generate discussion.
Ben C. Lucas shows his natural cinematic talents from the start, using ingredients to establish the world of social networking as a key element in the film
Without question one of the most striking Australian films of the past five years, director Lucas stamps his visual style on a very contemporary - and at times very confronting - teen revenge story.
