A creepily comical story about an insistent vagrant turned insidious home occupier.
It's the hypnotic little thriller's disturbing twists that make it such a singular -- and singularly weird -- experience.
Though it's too enigmatic for its own good and often feels like it's being made up as it goes, the Dutch import "Borgman" holds interest if only to see what might possibly happen next.
Clearly allegorical, but what exactly it speaks to (some personal version of familial unrest, no doubt) is probably different for everyone. Regardless, it's a fascinating film with darkly comic moments that bears repeated viewings.
Beautifully filmed and intellectually stimulating, Borgman is one of the most unique and exhilarating films of 2014 despite its lack of resolution and clarification.
Funny Games, indeed. Creepy, spooky and nightmarish.
Horror is far more unsettling when it's surrounded by teak furniture.
Borgman falls somewhere between Boudu and Rasputin in the canon of family interlopers, an instinctual manipulator who can pinpoint vulnerability with laser precision.
It's a sidelong coming-of-age that feels as though it skims the bittersweetness of its ending, but Lucky Them cares more about the trip than the destination.
Borgman is one of the oddest, most unsettling, most boldly and strikingly bizarre films I have seen in a long while.
It's a challenging but fascinating work that truly has be seen to be understoo -- er, appreciated.
Borgman stays compelling through sheer strangeness, gorgeous photography and sharp performances.
The degree of ambiguity involved in this scenario imbues each new twist with claustrophobia and dread.
Itinerant crooks or satanists? This bizarre import has the feel of a fever dream. Characters, most especially the eponymous gardener, float through the narrative as if in a Dr. Caligari-induced haze.
To watch the boundlessly unpredictable "Borgman" unpeel one disquieting layer at a time is to be simultaneously invigorated, terrified and humbled by the vastness of its macabre ambition.
Borgman is a film that lingers long after it's ended.
Borgman burrows under our skins by being different. Ironically, the fact that it's so different might scare the bulk of its potential audience away.
