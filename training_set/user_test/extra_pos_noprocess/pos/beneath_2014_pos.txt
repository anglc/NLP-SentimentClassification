A proudly lowbrow, low-budget monster movie that sees nothing wrong with the cheap-and-dirty shortcuts of yesteryear.
The title doesn't just refer to what lurks in the lake's still water. It's a guide to where Beneath's substance lies, the acid heart inside its plastic chest.
Beneath is both a tribute to monster-in-the-woods and the creature-under-the-water horror and a genuine indie drama in the guise of a horror film.
As shrill as it often is, the film's situational peril makes otherwise unlikable characters sympathetic, or maybe just sympathetic enough.
