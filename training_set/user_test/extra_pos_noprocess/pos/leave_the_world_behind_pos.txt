The film is certainly a visual delight, and does a better job than any film this critic has seen of reflecting how it feels to be at an electronic dance event of that size.
A stage-managed yet weirdly gripping documentary that tracks the final tour of DJ trio Swedish House Mafia.
Very much an in-house-made, authorised portrait, the film does a solid job of capturing the sweat, spectacle and subsonic kick of the live performances, but delivers only a sanitised version of why they're splitting up.
The documentary almost gets there, and should be applauded for its visual boldness and emotional articulateness. Even if you've never attended a rave or thrown your hands in the air, the movie has a singular power.
Leave The World Behind is a slightly shallow, yet still entertaining documentary about one of EDM's most influential groups.
