The movie is a psalm to those who, far from pursuing the path of the Rolling Stones, stayed trapped under a rock.
The period details are spot-on and the soundtrack is great.
Yes, it's about rock and New Jersey, but it's also about getting a life going and dreaming, and that's timeless, classic stuff.
Well-observed but occasionally disjointed, it's a film that's more about thematic tone, sound and images than it is driven by plot.
There are plenty of laughs along with the melodrama as the band and its members struggle through young adulthood.
There's a nice, pop-in-and-see rhythm to the storytelling. Gandolfini's Pat descends into a rich sadness. There's wry humour to be had with Douglas and his idealizing buddies. Loneliness and longing lounge around together.
Hits notes you thought only Chase's primo Sopranos could reach.
An exhilarating rush of keenly observant, sometimes barbed, occasionally funny and often poignant detail, and all of it feels right.
Beautifully captures the impact of the British rock 'n' roll invasion on young teens in the suburbs (I was there). . .But even with accurate details, the film loses its way.
...a rollicking comedy about growing up and striking out
Not Fade Away is about the imperishable idea of youth and the promise of endless wide-open possibility. Time will always be on its side.
Not Fade Away is intimate, episodic and achingly poignant. It's also woefully insubstantial. Chase has created less of a dramatic narrative and more of an awkwardly paced, formulaic collage.
Good- although I think it would work better as a TV series. I wish there was a season 2.
Because its more about intertwining themes than it is about obvious plot and conflict, it has melancholic energy. It revels in the mystery, appreciation, and ultimately creation of art-from a guy who was empowered and inspired by rock himself.
A wistful, bittersweet remembrance of the emerging '60s counterculture.
Rock & roll is salvation, rebellion, fun, sex, and the greatest middle finger ever extended by one generation at another. If you actually believe all of that, even a little bit, David Chase's far-from-perfect Not Fade Away is hard to dislike.
