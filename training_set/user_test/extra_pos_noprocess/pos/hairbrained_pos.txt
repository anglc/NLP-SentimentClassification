Billy Kent's charming HairBrained comes from a long legacy of collegiate comedies but still finds its own identity.
HairBrained is enjoyable, lightweight entertainment and, for a story about a genius, it requires very little thinking.
Think a poor man's cross of Napoleon Dynamite (2004) and Old School (2003) where a coming-of-age tale merges with a midlife crisis.
HairBrained[...] manages to play like a winning amalgam of Real Genius and Rushmore, even though it shouldn't work at all.
