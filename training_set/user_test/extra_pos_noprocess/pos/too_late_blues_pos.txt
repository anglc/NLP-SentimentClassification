It's pretentious, lugubrious, mawkish, and full of both naivete and macho bluster. It also has moments that are indelible and heartbreaking.
One of the more impressive Hollywood movies to be set in the hip, flip jazz world.
An uncompromising movie, for good and for ill.
One of the better and more honest jazz films ever made in Hollywood.
The jumpy, freewheeling Cassavetes style -- for which Darin's jazz, I suppose, is a metaphor -- seems well worth fighting for.
Interesting mainly for its jazz atmosphere and Darin's nonsinging performance.
