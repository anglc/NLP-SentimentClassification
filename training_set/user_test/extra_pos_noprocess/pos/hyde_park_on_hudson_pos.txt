Somewhat uneven and ultimately underwhelming, but there's plenty to admire and enjoy here nonetheless.
Essentially, Hyde Park on Hudson is a Shakespearean revel.
The performances across the board are strong, but it's Murray who's most impressive.
An unconventional drama that succeeds despite an uneven plot.
It's been a long time since Lost in Translation (2003), which is the last time Bill Murray did anything of real note in a film. Here he partially redeems the latter phase of his film career playing pre-war US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
A delightful piece of historical speculation grounded in historical details and personal recollections that have continually been coming to light over the last seventy years ... Murray is terrific in the part - charming, at ease and cunning as a fox.
With the incongruous casting of Bill Murray as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nelson's screenplay concentrates on the personal, offering a somewhat voyeuristic view of the events leading up to the 1939 visit of King George
Apparently Franklin Delano Roosevelt's polio paralysis didn't include everything below his waist. At least that's the impression left by Hyde Park on Hudson, which paints the president as a horn dog in chief... This isn't Lincoln, by a longshot.
