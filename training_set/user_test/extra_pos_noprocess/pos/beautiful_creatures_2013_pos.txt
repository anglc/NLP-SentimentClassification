This surprisingly beguiling attempt to blend fantasy, coming-of-age drama, melodrama, camp and social critique isn't always successful - but it's nearly always entertaining.
This fantasy about witches and warlocks walking among us was clearly produced for the Twilight crowd, but a witty script and the enjoyably hammy performances from Emma Thompson and Jeremy Irons broaden its appeal.
May tap into familiar themes of forbidden love oppression, but it's the unique texture of the world, along with the phenomenal cast surrounding it that makes this the most promising teen supernatural drama yet.
Surprisingly peppy and charming -- not transcendent of its narrowly defined genre, but a worthwhile entry in it, and not a bad film all around.
A startlingly good exploration of good, evil and the perseverance of love.
I wanted to know more about the Casters, and hopefully we'll get a sequel to round out the mythos better.
This is a perfectly solid coming-of-age fantasy, closer in spirit to 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' than to the recent spate of Stephenie Meyer clones.
Who would've thought that Emo Witches and Satanic Southern MILFS could end up being so entertaining?
...much weirder, cooler and knowing, more in league with something like The Perks of Being a Wallflower than anything Stephenie Meyer will ever create. It doesn't aim higher; it aims in several competing, uncharted directions.
Director Richard LaGravenese helms this dark-magic romantic fantasy, and it's surprisingly better than the unfair label with which it's been slapped (yep, you know the one: it just wants to be another damn Twilight)
There are some impressive special effects in the film, but these are used sparingly. The main story is the love affair, and it is surrounded by so much acting talent that the rest of the story works.
LaGravenese elicits some wonderfully hammy turns, particularly from Irons and Thompson, although a tighter edit wouldn't have gone amiss
While this movie easily has more charm than the cynically produced Twilight films, it somehow lacks the charisma.
