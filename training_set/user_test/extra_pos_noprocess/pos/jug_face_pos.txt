Creepy atmospherics enliven this idiosyncratic chiller.
An impressively oozing slab of indie horror that bodes well for first-time writer-director Chad Crawford Kinkle.
Kinkle shows welcome restraint in pacing his grimy little tale, even if the sum of its parts never quite feels like more than an admirably rendered campfire yarn.
Kinkle shows a deft hand at pacing and the gore is kept to a minimum.
"Jug Face" is not uniformly polished, yet it's a breakthrough, not so much for gore, or terror, but because the director can truly do tension, maybe a harder trick to pull off.
Jug Face becomes incredibly more terrifying once the themes of death are allowed to sink in, lingering in your mind hours after Kinkle's movie ends.
A rising tide of dread and desperation marks Jug Face, a low-budget, independent slice of Southern Gothic characterized by a solid technical package.
Chad Crawford Kinkle impressively imbues this supernatural world of backwoods mysticism with a plausible milieu while still staying committed to the film's own brewing insanity.
The best indie horror movie I've seen in years. Creepy and menacing.
dark and poetic horror territory
A well-acted, genre-busting curiosity, "Jug Face" is bold of premise and disquieting in its low-key mounting.
A steady pulse of dread, making the macabre aspects of the work all the more unsettling. It's a terrific picture, smartly made and sharply acted, and it's one of the best chillers of the year.
Intriguing without ever proving insightful, the film nonetheless has a formal patience and meticulousness that sets it apart from its jump-scare-loving mainstream-horror brethren.
Fans should expect an insanely bizarre and creepy slow-burn with a lot of good ideas, and precise execution.
