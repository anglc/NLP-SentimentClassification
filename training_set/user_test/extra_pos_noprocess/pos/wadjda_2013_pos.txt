The most radical and cheering message of Wadjda is that a change isn't just possible, but inevitable.
"Wadjda" earns extra points just for being what it is. Who knew that, in a country that famously frowns on women driving cars, some are even allowed to make movies?
This delightful debut feature by a Saudi woman named Haifaa Al-Mansour uses a bicycle as a metaphor for freedom within a social circumference.
A sweet little film about the human spirit, about want and energy and determination against unfair odds.
In Saudi filmmaker Haifaa al-Mansour's winsome wonder Wadjda, a young girl's aspirations provide an intimate glimpse into the possibilities and limitations of a cloaked culture.
More than a critique of Saudi society, "Wadjda" offers a character with universal resonance and appeal.
...a well-intentioned yet terminally uneven endeavor...
There are important films and there are good films, and the two do not necessarily always overlap. Wadjda is both important and very, very good.
Filmmaker Haifaa Al Mansour uses the simple story as our entry into a complex culture and a pointed perspective on how women are treated in Saudi society ...
This is a film to be admired for both its on-screen and off-screen story.
A warm, winning, restless film...Beautiful, modestly progressive and heartfelt, with a wonderful, brash central performance from first-timer Waad Mohammed.
The overall pro-freedom message comes through loud and clear. Rhetorically speaking, the trick of using childish innocence to reveal adult hypocrisy is virtually foolproof.
It's a provocative but credible premise and in exploring it, Al Mansour has come up with an engagingly subversive character. Wadjda is a delight.
The film disguises its liberal editorial message with a superbly veiled screenplay; we're just looking ... but of course, we're also seeing, a much more invasive activity
This charming and deceptively simple film about a rebellious young Saudi girl with a dream that defies the culture in which she lives, is a breath of fresh air; the insight into lifestyle and culture fascinating
By any standards, this [is] a fine, moving film and essential viewing for anyone who cares about contemporary cinema.
Her film is like she is, ostensibly playing by the rules, but throwing us enough sidewise glances to let us know that she's much smarter than she appears.
It has a neat, sly way of folding complex pissed-off politics into crowd-pleasing narrative simplicity.
A kindred spirit to "Offside" and "Persepolis", this film is ten times more inspiring than "Breakaway", another tale of an underdog and a bicycle. A must-see.
A series of close and long shots follow as Wadjda rides and wobbles, as she grins broadly and gains momentum in this tiny space, as she shares her glee with Abdullah. Even without using their voices, they express so much.
Rather than making a grand political statement, the film excels in its quieter and more intimate moments.
The movie ends on a highly emotional note that might easily have tipped over into bathos. But Al-Mansour knows her stuff -- she earns her emotion honestly.
Simple but charming.
Al Mansour's first feature film is a striking achievement.
Wadjda generally feels anchored in the authentic-feeling life of one authentic-feeling girl.
Films like Wadjda do not come around very often.
