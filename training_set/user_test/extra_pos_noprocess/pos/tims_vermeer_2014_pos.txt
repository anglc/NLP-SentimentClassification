"Tim's Vermeer" is about many things - art history, technology, painting technique, beauty - but ultimately it's a beguiling study of fascination.
We should never forget that Penn and Teller are professional bamboozlers, and their attempt to re-frame the definition of genius might be nothing but smoke and mirrors.
Unexpectedly dazzling.
Tim's Vermeer is film as forensics, bringing math and science to bear to solve an art-world mystery.
"Tim's Vermeer" is a movie for people who like to think, who like to ponder the big questions surrounding art and the act of creation.
Mostly it is fascinating and compelling.
Tim's Vermeer refers not just to the replica Vermeer he seeks to paint, but to his understanding of who Vermeer was and how he accomplished his work.
Perhaps the ultimate take-away from Tim's Vermeer is the unquenchable curiosity of certain people, albeit those with the money to finance that inquisitiveness, to get to the bottom of history's mysteries. In that respect, Jenison is an artist.
The lengths to which Jenison goes to ensure he is working with the same tools, limitations and liberties that were available to Vermeer are nothing short of gobsmacking.
What it turns out to actually be about is Tim Jenison, and what it means to be a member of the new (techno) rich in the United States of the 21st Century.
Tim's Vermeer is both enjoyable as entertainment and as an intelligently mounted case study of how art and technology complement, rather than grind against, each other. As Penn eloquently puts it: "The problem is we make that distinction."
A lively, intriguing look at the line between artist and inventor, one that challenges the very notion that the distinction should be made at all.
A masterpiece of documentary filmmaking
I can easily say that this film is more engaging than any action film I've seen of late, which is quite a remarkable achievement.
A wry, entertaining and very impressive study of a groundbreaking adventure in amateur art history
What emerges from this delightful, brief documentary doesn't debunk Vermeer's genius, but certifies it.
It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do - nothing more, nothing less.
The crossroads between technology and art has always been troublesome. Without either, we might not have some of the art world's greatest treasures. Certainly without digital video, we wouldn't have this wonderfully entertaining movie either.
It's obvious in hindsight why Penn and Teller would be so drawn to this ethereally beautiful mystery: Their passion for all things seemingly magical, often mechanical, and always amazing is practically their trademark.
It's a sophisticated treatise on the intersection between creativity and technology, presented with all the offhand charm of a great tale told over a round of beers.
Combining enough of the characteristic wiseassery of Penn & Teller with a dose of scholarly research on an age-old art-world mystery, it is at once entertaining and edifying.
