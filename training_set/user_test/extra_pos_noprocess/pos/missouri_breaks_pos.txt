A Western-as-capitalist-critique piece shanghaied by Marlon Brando's eccentric bounty hunter trying on brogues, mumus, and buckskin Nudie suits.
Interesting, even if not cohesive, Brando & Nicholson western.
Slightly lacking in tension but with a striking performance from Marlon Brando
If Penn failed to ride herd on his two superstars, he still was able to wrangle some sharp observations on the clash between the mythic old West and its reality
Brando's conversation with his horse, in which he notes that the animal has "the lips of Salome and the eyes of Cleopatra," must be seen to be believed...
Brando admittedly improvised quite a bit in his over-the-top role.
Although there are obvious flaws, there's a lot to recommend what turns out to be a dark, cynical work with some finely honed character acting from both men.
This appealingly eccentric revisionist western highlights the critical importance of violence in establishing 'civilized' society in the American wilderness.
