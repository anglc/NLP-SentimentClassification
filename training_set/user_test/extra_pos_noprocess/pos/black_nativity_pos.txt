Even the movie's most wretched characters glow in the Harlem lamplight.
Its pastoral ambitions compensate for its lack of finesse.
By the time the film reaches its biblically inspired dreamscape of a climax, "Black Nativity" qualifies as equal parts surreal and stirring.
Defiantly simple, like earlier stage pageants based on Langston Hughes' Christmas play, Kasi Lemmons' "Black Nativity" gains power through its directness.
You'd have to be pretty full of seasonal humbug to resist this ...
There's no doubting the sincerity and there's little point in offering up cynical resistance to an all-singing, all-dancing, all-emoting gospel finale.
The well-worn platitudes and pained moralising are a bit much, but the music is tremendous.
This modest little feel-good movie won't contend for any major awards (unlike Whitaker's other movie this year, 'The Butler'), but its heart is in the right place.
Sincerely spiritual and inspirational, turning the movie theater into a church and preaching to the choir.
Familiar and worn holiday story saved by most excellent music.
