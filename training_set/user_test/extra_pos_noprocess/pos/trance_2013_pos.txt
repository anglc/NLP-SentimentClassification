Trance is high-order, film noir nonsense that takes Boyle back to the thrillers he made at the start of his career with John Hodge (he wrote Trance, too), like Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, that were preoccupied with the grimy corners of the psyche.
Trance is to Danny Boyle more or less as Side Effects was to Steven Soderbergh: an arty spin on a trashy B-movie, engineered to showcase the director's particular gifts.
The story draws us in even through the murk.
Dawson walks through this film with majestic confidence while McAvoy is constantly inches from a full breakdown. And Boyle keeps that tension mesmerizing.
In less qualified hands, Trance wouldn't be this entertaining.
It goes off the rails, but in a way that's exciting and reinvigorating.
[Director Danny] Boyle has not only delivered a first-rate thriller, he has produced a film that should inspire healthy debate... both about its plotting and characters. In a world of disposable entertainment, it is a lasting piece of art.
The trance angle adds an interesting dimension to an otherwise routine crime caper flick.
Multi-layered and beautifully-filmed by Oscar winner Danny Boyle, this drama lets viewers into the world of art and hypnosis in a tale that should be talked about long after the credits roll.
It's a film that blurs several lines - including those between fantasy and reality, heroes and villains, and fact and fiction - and does so in a way that puts a fresh and compelling spin on contemporary film noir and heist pictures.
A complex, breakneck and stirring modern thriller, superb in both execution and conceptual ideas even if it is a little over-indulgent.
The unpredictable journey through fluid and malleable concepts of reality and identity is consistently gripping.
