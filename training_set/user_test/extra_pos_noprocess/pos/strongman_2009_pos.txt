One cannot help but think of Fellini's Zampano and Gelsomina.
Strongman is a tantalizing example of the kind of documentary I find engrossing: A film about an unusual person that invites us into the mystery of a human life.
Though Levy's film feels shapeless at times, what it loses in structure, it gains in handheld intimacy, letting viewers get to know the mercurial but fundamentally sweet Pleskun.
An outsider tale of unforced rawness and lilting poignancy.
A warts-and-all documentary from first-time director Zachary Levy that moves in close and stays there.
Without being intrusive, Levy chronicles these lives like a trusted family member, and Strongman allows a privileged and affectionate glimpse of a truly American dreamer.
Not to take anything away from Levy's heartwarming approach into the unfamiliar world of strongmen, but it would take more than just a bit of willpower to stay in the same room with Stan and his inflated ego for more than half an hour.
Strongman is a heartrending character study of a man blessed with superhuman strength, but defeated and overwhelmed by the everyday bullshit of life.
Fascinating, funny and intimate portrait of Stanless Steel, who likes to lift and bend things.
Strongman's unvarnished approach complements its salt of the earth subject.
Though the execution is nearly flawless, the film is difficult to sit through in its entirety.
Thoroughly fascinating, heartfelt and unflinchingly candid.
Sad power rises from this doc about a guy who can bend pennies and elevate 10,000-pound trucks.
... [W]e're never sure how to take Stanless Steel. Is this guy irrepressibly optimistic, or just willfully self-deluded?
Zachary Levy's documentary is an original portrait of a distinctive soul who can lift trucks off the ground but cannot get himself out of a rut.
Ten years in the making, Zachary Levy's film is a stark and arresting study of a simple man trying to do good with what he's got.
