A terrible yet lovable take on the haunted-house yarn.
It's not the derivative scares and rudimentary effects that keep this low-budget effort percolating but the improvisational energy of Mr. Santos and Mr. Villarreal, whose ease, chemistry and humor never flag.
Really runs out of steam near the end, but there's still a nice batch of raunchy laughs here.
Rather than going straight for the laughs and only the laughs, Ghost Team One delivers two well developed, likable characters that turn the film into an effective narrative capable of sustaining the best and worst of its comedic repertoire.
