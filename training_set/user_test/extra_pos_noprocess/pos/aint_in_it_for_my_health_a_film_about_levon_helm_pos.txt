[A] bittersweet, frustratingly impressionistic documentary ...
Loose and ragtag, stirring and poignant, the documentary "Ain't in It for My Health: A Film About Levon Helm" proves a fitting tribute to its late star ...
The portrait of the ailing artist is bittersweet, but when Helms sings or plays, the look on his face is pure joy.
It's a sympathetic portrait of an artist whose heart lay more with new work than old glories, right up to the end.
An affectionate tribute and a gift for fans who grew fond of his company on records or at concerts and who would like a little bit more.
And of all the figures - Bob Dylan, Gram Parsons, et al. - who smuggled those sepia-toned seeds into rock 'n' roll, Helm, was arguably the most authentic.
Heartfelt tribute to musician Levon Helm receives a theatrical release on the anniversary of his death in 2012.
A portrait of a tough American musical spirit, fighting through until the end and taking energy and solace from the music he created.
