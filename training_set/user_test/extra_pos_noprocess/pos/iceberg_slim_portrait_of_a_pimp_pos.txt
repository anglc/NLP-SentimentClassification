[Dierctor Jorge] Hinojosa does a good job of showing Iceberg's humanity without glossing over the viciousness of his chosen profession.
Beck's widow, his ex-wife and three daughters paint the man as someone whose success only complicated his life, estranging him from his family and eventually saddling him with crippling inertia.
Docu admires and glamorizes pimping with celeb interviews.
The question of how deep a scumbag's amends must run hangs uneasily over the entire movie, which awkwardly straddles the line between amiable hagiography and a more discerning sociological study.
After an unpromising beginning, Iceberg Slim develops into a thorny, engaging exploration of the strange twilight and late-in-life fame of a bona fide American outlaw.
It certainly threatens to succumb to hero worship, but Jorge Hinojosa wisely subverts Slim's mythos by pulling the curtain back on it in the doc's second half by revealing the man beneath.
If the subject interests you, buy and read a couple of Iceberg's books. This film is for entertainment only, although there is substantial entertainment to be had.
