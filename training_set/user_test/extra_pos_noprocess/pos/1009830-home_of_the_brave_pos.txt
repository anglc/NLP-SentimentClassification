Well produced and intelligently directed by Mark Robson.
For all its predictability .. an honourable and well intentioned effort to explore the trauma of war vets coming home from the hell of Iraq to the different kind of hell of suburban Spokane
Edwards gives a sensitive performance, and Mark Robson's direction never condescends or makes him an object of bleeding-heart pity.
Not without some hard-hitting moments.
