A pretty eerie and tense, albeit flawed, horror entry.
It's a bit rough round the edges but just wait for Begos to get his hands on some real money and we can expect something very special indeed.
Begos' film drips and oozes with straight-to-video nostalgia
...more than competent and less than inspired, [Almost Human] should find a nontheatrical niche among genre fans.
Almost Human is a hybrid alien abduction/slasher film that embodies everything awesome about horror in the 1980s - gooey practical effects and all.
It's gruesome, sure, but Begos is hardly your run-of-the-mill grue merchant. He knows how to tighten the screws and, with a tip of the hat to 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' ensnarl us in an ever-widening web of paranoia.
Is "Almost Human" an alien invasion story? A gory slasher flick? A tribute to B-movies as a collective? It is all of the above, and really rather groovy.
Feels like a "throwback" that's not a rip-off, and a mild satire that clearly loves the stuff it's poking fun at.
