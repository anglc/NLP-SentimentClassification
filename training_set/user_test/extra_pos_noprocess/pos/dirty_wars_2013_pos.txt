[A] gripping investigative doc, which plays out like a classic conspiracy thriller as it follows a trail of clues to the heart of darkness.
It makes you wonder - what don't we know?
By emphasizing the human cost of the operation, Scahill and Rowling turn "blowback" into much more than an abstract military-political term.
These wars being fought in our name may be dirty, but this courageous film reminds us that as long as we have a free press, they don't have to be secret.
Dirty Wars is essential viewing for all Americans, conservatives and liberals alike. It's intense and depressing. It'll make you angry.
Dirty Wars is challenging in a way few films are.
This documentary is at least in theory non-political and not intended as overview of the past thirteen years. Instead, the filmmakers insist, it captures a moment in time on a downward spiral.
An infuriating and depressing look at how American foreign policy and warfare have been transformed in highly undemocratic ways, and a reminder of what real journalism looks like.
"Dirty Wars" may lack the nuance and design of an Errol Morris documentary, but it is nonetheless the most important and searing documentary of 2013. See it. Talk about it.
This is a very disturbing film. From a journalistic point of view, it would be better to have more documentation for the claims made in this film, but enough evidence is presented to raise concerns about these secret wars.
Not quite as tight as it needs to be, especially when it comes to building links between its various strands, this is nevertheless an intriguing documentary which contains some powerful interview material.
A tense, shocking US documentary that plays out like an episode of The Wire, though in this case it's not a war on drugs that's being fought (and lost), but the war on terror.
Government sanctioned atrocities and journalist Jeremy Scahill fight for top billing in this investigative doc.
The movie has rather silly, Bourne-style thriller graphics, which are unnecessary: it has an important story to tell.
A fearless and passionately directed documentary, Dirty Wars is a gripping and thought-provoking film fuelling the heated debate about the ethics of the US government and military.
offers geopolitical exposition & humanist perspective on a nation's hidden & entirely unregulated foreign policy, seemingly designed to create ever more enemies for the US in an expanding global war that is kept out of view, with no end in sight.
Hard-hitting stuff and tough medicine for American foreign policy loyalists.
Though awkwardly assembled, with an overemphatic voiceover, it's chilling stuff.
Relentlessly questions the military aims of American foreign policy.
... though I have certain qualms about the way Scahill is presented in the film ... I cannot imagine that a more compelling film could have been made without his character carrying this dramatic payload.
"Dirty Wars" becomes more than the sum of its facts, illuminating not just the secret wars but the emotional toll that trying to uncover them takes on Scahill.
[C]onnects how the celebrated successes and piecemeal scandals about the global war on terror fit into an alarming U.S. military policy. . [but] gets confusingly repetitive.
This is a film you skip seeing at your own risk.
