[To] gives a solid 90 minutes of edgy foreplay before delivering the goods.
Few other working filmmakers display this degree of visual sophistication and old-school craftsmanship.
As always, To delivers fantastic set pieces ...
Drug War is a deeply intelligent, exhilarating and eminently satisfying adult crime story, one of the best thrillers you're likely to see this year.
An intense and constantly surprising crime story in which destiny seems to fold in on itself ...
What the hell: "Drug War" is a taut, minor masterpiece. It felt like watching early Walter Hill for the first time-"The Driver," "Southern Comfort"-and that is a very good feeling indeed.
Almost perfect.
...as nimble as a ballet dancer, even while dancing in muck.
A nicely tangled, smartly paced and cold little thriller-nothing more, nothing less.
The most purely enjoyable action film of the year, and I can only hope the inevitable American remake doesn't screw it up too badly
The routine police procedural crime drama has dedicated Chinese narcotics cops closing in on a big-time drug manufacturer in a risky undercover operation.
This film about cops and drug dealers in China is a lot like a story set in the Old West with outlaws and lawmen engaged in gun battles. There probably is a point to all this conflict that is lost in the translation.
Visually, it's a gritty throwback that's certain to please genre aficionados.
"Drug War" may not add anything particularly new to the genre, but that doesn't make it any less of a thrilling ride.
Cops and robbers, drugs and money, and the brutal violence at the end of it all: Yes, Hong Kong action director Johnnie To is back in town.
To orchestrates a huge cast and multi-layered plot like the ringmaster of a three-ring circus, his explosive, nihilistic finale layered with betrayals.
To's film is solidly directed, and brutal and unflinching in its depiction of the drug world at the center of the story.
Filled with intrigue, plot twists and monumental gunfights, it's an expertly crafted if at times quite violent affair.
Like a cross between "The Wire" and "The French Connection," even if To's blood-drenched fatalism goes a little overboard by the end. Despite the familiarity, it's an impressive piece of work.
