[Blu-ray Review] No one will be confusing "Big Ass Spider!" for anything more than it isa silly sci-fi comedy about a giant spider on the looseand that's okay.
It's a lively, slick little film with a clear ambition to revive the thrills and chills of the subgenre, with particular attention to consistency and gaiety.
The most pressing mental involvement that Mike Mendez's silly, scary guilty pleasure requires is - where does one place the inflection?
With a 30-rack of brewskis and some equally demented friends, Big Ass Spider could be one rockin' midnight movie experience worth a good laugh.
...oesn't deserve to be treated as one of those awful, misbegotten projects that can only be enjoyed ironically. It's a genuinely nice little movie and the people involved with it ought to have the opportunity to make more movies.
Revels in its silliness, and has a good time with its premise, creating a fun monster movie...
It's the kind of movie you wish they still had drive-ins for.
All the pacing of a classic monster movie is here, though director Mike Mendez is a bit more generous with revealing his carnivorous critter than some (I assume the budget was fairly small, but he gets value out of it).

If you are a fan of the big monster genre Big Ass Spider! is a great film to waste a Friday night on.
