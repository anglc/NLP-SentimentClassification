There are satisfying echoes of Stephen King's sly black humour in this deliciously nasty comedy thriller.
Screenwriters David Chirchirillo and Trent Haaga pose a simple question -- how much will a person degrade himself to make ends meet? -- but it's a potent one, at least for those of us who ponder it every Monday through Friday.
Let's just say it takes a dim view of human nature that seems well supported by the evidence, and that if you have an appetite for fatalistic, dirty-minded gore you won't be disappointed.
If Cheap Thrills ultimately does carry us along, it's due largely to Healy's performance and presence.
You should watch it as a twisted comedy. Those who do will be rewarded, especially by the film's outlandish final image.
To describe them would diminish their impact, but there are several occasions where it is tough to keep looking at the screen. Yet, thanks to the characters and their portrayals, you can't really look away, either.
Gird your stomach for Cheap Thrills, a bloody but enjoyably ironic horror which enters that queasy zone where Michael Haneke's Funny Games meets a reality-TV bush tucker trial.
The film makes the most of its premise and small cast, zipping from low-budget drama to sick black comedy to gruesome thriller.
Director EL Katz ratchets up the tension effectively as the game gets ever more sickeningly dark, but it's his cast's fine performances that keep us watching and give this far-fetched tale a degree of emotional plausibility.
Comedies don't get much more pitch-black than this fiendishly clever film, which will shift into horror for everyone in the audience, although that tipping point varies for each person.
You can take the result as either smart satire or sick schlock - frankly, it works on both scores.
E L Katz's film delivers exactly what the title promises. It is a very bloody, very violent fairground ride of a movie that ratchets up the tension as its two hapless anti-heroes compete desperately for money.
The blackest and most twisted of twisted black comedies, surely destined to become that indistinct phenomenon, a cult hit.
The film-makers' undisguised glee in the revolting catalogue of horrors is a delight to behold, and the sense of naked misanthropy is queasily invigorating throughout.
It's a thought-provoking ride, particularly in a post-financial crisis world where a combination of desperation and temptation can make anyone consider doing the unthinkable.
Cheap Thrills is the sort of film that makes you want to applaud as soon as it ends ... a must for anyone with a penchant for the darker side of cinema.
Immensely funny and appallingly blunt at the same time, it's a comedy with a soul as black as they come.
A darkly twisted satire on a world in which the rich get richer and the poor are easy pickings for callous exploitation.
The script is smarter than the premise sounds, with writers David Chirchirillo and Trent Haaga dispensing enough information to make victims both sympathetic and despicable, the instigators charismatic and sinister.
For genre fans, Katz's film will go down as a punchy and absorbing diversion, but it's also an offer you can refuse to believe. A better film would have given you no choice.
The film would be nasty if it weren't clever (and sometimes horribly funny).
Funny Games for the recession generation.
A bluesy drinking session evolves into messy violence for kicks in this nifty debut feature from E L Katz.
These characters are achingly familiar, a reminder that all of us are willing to play our own private, primal games of commerce and sacrifice to get what we want from life.
It's Faust meets bum fights in this sick black comedy for our economically polarized age.
