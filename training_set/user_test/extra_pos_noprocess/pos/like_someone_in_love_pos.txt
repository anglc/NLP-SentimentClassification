Making only his second film outside of his native Iran, Kiarostami undercuts the rigid protocols of polite Japanese society with intimations of violence.
Kiarostami's apparent simplicity masks serious complexity.
Kiarostami is masterful in his layering of space, using glass walls, mirrors, and, in one instance, the aligned side windows of parked cars to suggest a world of divisions, both between people and within them.
A Rorschach test of our own responses to the intimate drama unfolding before us.
The latest small, perplexing masterpiece from the Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami, who in recent years has chosen the path of a world director.
Kiarostami still possesses a remarkable knack for crafting vivid supporting characters from just a few details.
It superbly plays out as an homage to Ozu family dramas.
[An] infuriating - but also fascinating - effort ...
As an exercise in conveying place, mood and human foible, this is consistently intriguing.
[Kiarostami] almost throws up something magical, here.
This is an intriguing, elliptical affair, the emphasis on reflective surfaces (and off-screen voices) reminding us that we are only ever seeing an opaque refraction of the whole picture.
The septuagenarian's most playful tendencies have been liberated and he has started to make films that look like the work of a younger director raised on vintage Kiarostami.
[A] beautiful, subtly tender and narratively slight film ...
A major statement from one of the world's greatest living filmmakers.
Like the best dreams always do, it ends with a jolt, but its ideas and images linger like dust in sunlight.
A tender and touching drama about a young high-class escort who forms a connection with an elderly widower, but certain scenes in this quiet slow-burner feel overstretched and arguably unnecessary.
A film that feels unique and innovative.
Now practically an exile from his homeland, Kiarostami follows Certified Copy with another film-literate relationship drama with the enigmatic overtones of Hitchcock.
From the incredible opening shot onwards, it's clear Kiarostami's cinematic language translates perfectly in any setting.
Like Someone In Love explores familiar Kiarostami themes - how we slip between roles in our relationships - with a terrifically light touch, making for his best since 1999's The Wind Will Carry Us.
Veteran Director Abbas Kiarostami's Like Someone is a fine followup to his brilliant Certified Copy. It's lovely, intriguing, stylish and very, very good.
