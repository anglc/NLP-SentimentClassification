Modest and good-looking, the film starts as dark comedy and ends in pathos. Director Alvarez makes the Oregon scenery a character unto itself.
a dramedy that keeps you guessing where the main character is going (emotionally and physically) as he drifts from one odd situation to the next.
The film features snappy, hilarious bits among the coming-of-age vignettes, but it loses momentum as it winds toward a finish. You won't grow bored with the characters, but you might check your watch a few times.
There are a few stretches in C.O.G. where the movie feels like it's dawdling, much like its protagonist. But the wonderfully sad, exhilarating ending proves this filmmaker knew exactly where he was headed the entire time.
A promising sophomore effort from Easier with Practice writer/director Kyle Patrick Alvarez, and a great star turn for Jonathan Groff.
A coming-of age story with specific touches but a universal appeal.
The sardonic humor hits the mark more often than not, and Groff brings sympathy to an otherwise smug and pretentious character.
This America takes some getting used to.
Everyone in this wonderful surprise is looking for a place to belong while ultimately having to look out for No. 1. And I don't mean that in the spiritual sense.
Despite some good performances and sharp screenplay, C.O.G., like its lead character, seems stuck in the space between.
People who approach it as a film in its own right, with its own rhythms and goals and pleasures, will be amply rewarded.
"C.O.G" is like a collage of Americana from the perspective of someone incapable of comprehending its value.
Bolstered by beautiful cinematographic framing that expresses his alienation, the film strikes a fine balance between hilarity and heartbreak.
