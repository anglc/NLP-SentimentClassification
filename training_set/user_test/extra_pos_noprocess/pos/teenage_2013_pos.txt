Deftly weaves together various media in a way that breathes its own youthful, stream-of-conscious life into the documentary genre.

If Teenage delivers a sweeping generalization or two (or three) ... Wolf's documentary makes up for it with footage that's just too good to be ignored.

Insightful docu traces historical evolution of adolescence.
More well-crafted experience than historical chronicle, Teenage is an illustrative portrait of adolescence from the attempted point-of-view of those who first made sense of it
It's a terrific distraction, but it ultimately leaves you unfulfilled.
"Teenage" does what a good documentary should: educate and entertain.

It's an unusual experience -- I kept waiting for what felt like an extended prologue to end and the movie to start -- but once it settles in, you're off on a cultural time-trip without a guide or a net.
The archival footage is mesmerizing stuff, articulately edited by Joe Beshenkovsky.
Wolf reveals himself to be a gifted and intuitive filmmaker, able to make academic connections that are still true to the depth of feeling attached to teenagedom -- of living very seriously, except when absolutely not.
