T.S. Eliot and William Blake have their say, and a pigeon-capturing lady on the streets gets more screen time than Lady Diana. But this is no crazy quilt.
Temple's fragmented approach bespeaks the very nature of the place he's celebrating. For it seems that only through these wide variety of elements, these individual building blocks making a whole, that we can really get a sense of this remarkable city.
A distinct sort of time travelogue of the city's rougher patches ... the kind of doc that scores the suffragette movement to "Oh Bondage Up Yours!" by X-Ray Spex.
A movie to cherish.
A dizzying collage of all the changes in London's social and architectural fabric since light was first trained through celluloid.
A very heady experience.
This isn't the cinema's last word on London, but it will silence competitors for a few years to come.
