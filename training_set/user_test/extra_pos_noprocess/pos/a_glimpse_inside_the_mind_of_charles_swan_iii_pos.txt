A light (and slight) surrealistic comedy of emotional waywardness -- intriguing enough to qualify as a playful lark.
It's a nearly perfect apology for the existence of Sheen2013, packaging him as a man out of time, born too late to be the kind of louche, decadent figure he'd easily get away with being 40 years ago.
At once feeds into and deconstructs the Sheen persona; it also serves as a welcome reminder that, when he's not busy "winning" or having a public meltdown, the man is a charismatic onscreen presence.
