This curiously intimate documentary about artist Altina Schinasi, as told through her myriad marriages, engrosses in its own fittingly slapdash way.
An absorbing look at wealth, privilege, creativity and progressive thinking.
To Ms. Schinasi's credit, two of her husbands break down in tears on camera while talking about her, and the other two are dead.
A joyful portrait, although it doesn't leave out some blemishes.
Altina Schinasi was like Peggy Guggenheim-a member of the Jewish haut bourgeoisie who opted for a bohemian life in the arts. Jewish cultural history of a key but neglected figure.
A frustrating tease of a tribute that seems to merely scratch the surface of an overprotected child of privilege-turned-irrepressible bon vivant.
