Moment by moment, it all adds up. The scenes of the family huddling and hugging, greeting and parting, and reaffirming primal bonds are quietly moving.
The film's day-to-day aches are quiet and lovingly rendered.
Wise and involving ...
Five years in the life of a couple who must improvise their marriage and family life when he is in prison, learning that difficulties in marriage are opportunities to discover ever deeper reserves of love.
Here there is glory in the lives of simple, unprivileged folk and the more-or-less banal events of their daily lives.
While the film charts its protagonist's gradual progression toward a renewed sense of agency and freedom, it rarely indulges in lengthy or even linear narrative arcs.
Everyday might be [Michael Winterbottom's] most ambitious yet, even if it feels like his most modest.
Utilising fluid shots of the English countryside set to one of Michael Nyman's most dynamic scores, Winterbottom makes something surprisingly lyrical of the non-story

It is a sensitive, understated film but it does require a good deal of patience on the part of the viewer.
[A] resolutely realistic drama about a prisoner and his family visits.
Another great success for the endlessly creative and productive Winterbottom.
