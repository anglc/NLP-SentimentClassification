Director Jason Osder's grieving account of the deadly police assault on the MOVE collective's fortified Philadelphia row house works small, continuous miracles with a variety of existing footage.
Jason Osder's stunning debut documentary offers a disturbing look at a forgotten tragedy.
[Osder] cuts between news footage of the events as they unfurled and testimony from hearings held afterward to create a stark, nonjudgmental portrait of an incident that probably needn't have happened.
"Let the Fire Burn" offers a searing picture of how dumb and dangerous humans can be.
It's scary as both a movie and a still-reverberating moment in time.
Brilliantly edited, the film moves back and forth in time, first tracking the events leading up to the confrontation through news reports of the day.
[This historic footage -- from newsreels, TV stations once-live coverage, from several investigating commissions -- has been edited, brilliantly into a coherent, important political film.
It's a remarkably evenhanded telling of a story in which there could be no winners, using archival footage alone.
Let The Fire Burn is an incendiary documentary that uses archival footage to weave a compelling, all-important tale of tragedy bred from anger and misunderstanding.
Apart from the score and the very occasional basic intertitle to help us along, all we see and hear is footage from the day. We're immersed in the present of this world.
It's gripping and shocking.
Mesmerizing and provocative, Burn creates an unnerving atmosphere of troubling decisions on both sides of the conflict, permitting the viewer to understand the thought process that went into the explosive endgame.
Quietly terrifying.
No contemporary talking heads; none needed.
A stain on a city's past
Shocking events in Philadelphia get their day at the movies
