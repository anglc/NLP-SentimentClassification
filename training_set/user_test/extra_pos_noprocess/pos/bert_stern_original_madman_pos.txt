An effusive, sad, visually gorgeous, and illuminating portrait of the artist.
Now in his 80s, Stern recalls his rise, fall and reinvention without evasion or apology.
Feels as though it's all Laumeister could squeeze out of artist before he tired of her company. Although erratic, the picture maintains a basic understanding of Stern's peculiarities and urges.
Real life Mad Man would make Don Draper jealous.
Needs someone tougher to ask questions.
"Mad Man" presents a tantalizing overview of Stern's work as a photographer, confidently placing him among the greats in his field. But Stern as a person? Not so great.
Here's a documentary that comes from an unusual angle, the subject's lover looking at both the artist and the man dispensing with rose colored glasses.
Absolutely smashing, revealing documentary about one of the great photographers of our time.
Highly entertaining, but not revealing or insightful enough.
