The true comeback story in this fictional comeback story doesn't belong to a character named Burt Wonderstone, but to an actor named Jim Carrey.
This comedy about a magician who must hit bottom before rising again to the wonder of his beloved craft pulls plenty of sweet moments and a slew of laughs out of a story that might have been thin air.
This may be the kind of semi-bad, semi-inspired comedy that could not only stand repeated viewings but perhaps improve with them.
Carrey is the movie's ace up its sleeve. He's at his frighteningly manic best. If the Academy ever considered awards for comedies released in March, Carrey certainly deserves one.
Normally, this type of comedy would be a fun, forgettable ride. But these days, it feels like a welcomed wonder.
A sweet film with a message of never giving up on your dreams, "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone" gets by on the magic of a game cast.
Conjures up some laughs, if nothing else
