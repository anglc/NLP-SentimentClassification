The movie, as have other eco-documentaries, chillingly examines how endless bits of the toxic material routinely flood our oceans, harm its inhabitants and find their way into the fish we eat.
If we must talk trash, Mr. Irons - assisted by a scientist or two and Vangelis's doomy score - is an inspired choice of guide.
Crucial viewing for realists and alarmists both.
The form is straightforward, if a little meandering, as is the message: We have to fix this.
While its techniques are manipulative -- it's certainly no margin-call to say that Vangelis's two-dimensional score barely lets up from start to finish -- the picture ultimately swerves pitfalls of hectoring preachiness.
Some arguments are a bit hamfisted, and Irons plays the serious journalist card a little too hard, but overall, Trashed is thought-provoking and illuminating.
A vividly sketched doc of environmental warning which deploys co-producer Jeremy Irons as its inquisitive guide, Candida Brady's film serves as a compelling indictment of modern profligacy.
This eye-opening and educational documentary about the shocking and brutal effects of our global waste problem will make you sit up, listen, and reconsider your lifestyle and diet choices.
A timely doc that seeks to amuse and inform as much as alarm.
Jeremy Irons talks Trashed, as the actor turned civilian ventures across the globe in search of solutions to the ecological crisis of mounting waste material everywhere. While uniquely casting himself as a protagonist in a documentary.
A patchy but grimly compelling documentary about the environmental threat of rubbish.
A committed, thought-provoking documentary.
