Few films have opening images more chilling than the ruins of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, or more bleak than the last 10 minutes of "Nuclear Nation."
For the most part, the movie takes an eye-level approach to the disaster, focusing on the experiences of ordinary people living in makeshift shelters and public housing, lining up for food, and returning to their homes in hazmat suits.
[Funahashi's] approach is direct, intimate yet respectful, and sometimes as mournful as the stark piano-and-flute score.
This documentary sometimes lingers on vistas better suited to a Godzilla movie, strewn with rubble, devoid of souls.
If nothing else, the film will force you to reassess all the arguments for and against nuclear power.
An assured and sobering documentary that charts the situation in Futaba, Japan, shortly after the 2011 meltdown at the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.
The result is not exactly riveting cinema....it often seems caught between trying to tell a story...and its recognition that the story it has to tell is no story.
Nuclear Nation's anti-nuclear stance is very clear, but it admirably wants viewers to understand its argument instead of shouting it at them.
