The city's seedy charm has not often been captured so atmospherically.
The film can be seen as simply a kind of impressionistic travelogue, but it slowly and irresistibly conveys that we're also seeing a rite of passage.
"Tchoupitoulas" is a jewel-bright whoosh of a ride through nighttime New Orleans.
It is alive with the risk and curiosity of youth, and unapologetic in insisting that the pursuit of fun can be a profound and transformative experience.
The Rosses are happy to trade cohesion for a rich, varied immersion in New Orleans nightlife. It's less a documentary than a feature-length vibe.
Questions about the literal truth of Tchoupitoulas are thorny and perhaps besides the point. After all, the filmmakers aren't hiding the artifice.
A lovely, lyrical film that wondrously captures a very specific time and place -- that is, New Orleans at night, as seen through the eyes of a child.
At 80 minutes, the film feels a bit long. That's probably an example of the filmmakers' affection for their subjects, both the Zanders brothers and New Orleans.
With wide-eyed wonder, three young brothers are charmed by New Orleans' spectacular nightlife for the first time.
Without offering much context or addressing obvious social issues, it's an evocative tribute to its setting and to childhood innocence.
The film is entirely immersive, thanks not only to the handheld camera, but also to the illusory nature of the staging.
Tchoupitoulas posits time and space as internal experience, embracing subjectivity and uncertainty, not so much recording what happens as helping you to imagine possibilities.
Shooting in what sometimes approximates a semi-inebriated haze, and emphasizing the overlapping of diverse sounds coming from different quarters, Tchoupitoulas almost does manage to transcend the sight and sound limitations of cinema.
