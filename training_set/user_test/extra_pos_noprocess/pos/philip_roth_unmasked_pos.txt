It's great to see extensive interview footage with the relaxed and funny author, but Philip Roth: Unmasked shies away from controversy and, as a result, feels a bit sanitized.
It's good that Philip Roth finally let others in during the waning years of an extraordinary writing life.
For some 90 minutes, it's pretty much just one guy talking. But what a guy!
Admiring if less than revealing documentary about one of the great writers of our time.
