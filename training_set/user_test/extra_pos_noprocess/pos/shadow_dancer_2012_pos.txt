The film relies on terse dialogue and boggy colors to create an atmosphere dense with anxiety -- all well handled by director James March.
A tautly minimalist, occasionally generic study of betrayal and family ties.
[Riseborough's] work is indrawn and riveting. It's hard to read the look in her eye, but we never stop trying.
These are characters for whom true belief in a cause has probably become impossible; they know how much that costs. Marsh does a compelling job of illustrating that for the rest of us.
Plays slyly with noir; adroitly twists and turns away from easy expectations in its final minutes. This thriller's got one sharp, savage ending. Marsh takes a black-eyed stare out from the gravestone-gray, waning days of the Troubles.
A grim but measured and intelligent art-house slow-burner.
The acting in this film is very good. The plot is lean and powerful. It is pretty depressing, but it seems true enough in its depiction of this troubled period of history.
By the end, the film shows not only the power of this influence but also its terrible price in an often merciless conflict.
It's absorbing, intelligent and sad.
Themes ripped from today's headlines lend "The Troubles" of Northern Ireland very tense, sobering, contemporary immediacy. . . Riseborough [is] mesmerizing at first sight.
[Director James Marsh] shows a deft hand with his actors and elicits a notable performance from [Andrea] Riseborough. The production is straightforward on all fronts and catches the bleakness hovering above Belfast under siege.
Marsh focuses this slowly simmering drama on more universal themes of family, betrayal and decisions that people make that are both right and wrong at the same time.
a potent, ultimately disheartening slow-burn drama
...a quietly disturbing look at the choices placed before someone who is caught between two worlds, neither offering harbor.
Shadow Dancer is a quiet film that demands careful attention...
