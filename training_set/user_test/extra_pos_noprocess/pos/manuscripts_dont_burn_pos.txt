Unlike Rasoulof and Panahi's previous, more metaphorical films, this one confronts its subject head-on with unflinching candor.
A fairly gripping thriller, and Rasoulof's most angry work to date.
Mohammad Rasoulof's slow-burning, clandestinely made fifth feature is a brave, challenging look at Iran's feared security apparatus.
A slow-motion explosion of anti-authoritarian rage.
Manuscripts Don't Burn is more rueful than action-packed, yet it simmers with righteous refusal. That's what gives the movie a power no Bourne flick will ever match.
Harrowing, defiant, and exemplifying through its very existence the moral courage its totalitarian villains stamp down ...
"Manuscripts Don't Burn" is one of the best films I've seen this year, and one of the hardest to watch.
Rosoulof's film is shocking, relentless, a remarkable piece of work.
The results are challenging and alarming; the film-making brave and defiant.
Rasoulof constructs a vivid portrait of a paranoid state, but he also manages to incorporate some fingernail-endangering tension into the piece.
A crackling, tense thriller, graced with beautifully measured performances, that explores with wisdom and sorrow the best and worst in human nature.
A potent work for all sorts of reasons.
Only from a distance can you appreciate what a remarkable feat this film is.
A story those who live blithely in freedom quite simply need to see.
The film's flaws are forgivable; its very existence should be applauded.
The message is so important - and Rasoulof is conveying it under such difficult conditions - that the film rather transcends normal considerations.
A strong, daring, haunting film.
In a way, it makes as much sense to review this like any other movie as it does to review a mass demonstration or a strike. If you understand the film's political importance, you understand the need to see it and recommend it widely.
...[W]arts and all, this is a piece of work that needs to be disseminated and talked about.
Its chilly, muted colors, claustrophobic framings and understated performances by an excellent cast recall '70s American suspensers such as "The Conversation" and "Klute."
Rasoulof creates the sense that we're not only witnessing a bleak reality, but hovering inside of it, uncertain if the nightmare will ever end.
