"The Machine" percolates with an elegantly palpable sense of wonder and danger.
A classy slice of cerebral sci-fi with a literary-cinematic heritage stretching back through Blade Runner and Metropolis to Frankenstein.
Good British sci-fis don't come along very often, so this stylish slice of a dystopian near-future should be welcomed by fans.
The film is ambitious visually, in spite of its small budget, and while not all of the effects come off, it's hard to hold that against an indie production like this.
The first hour's setup of "The Machine" is better than the threadbare guns-blazing action payoff, but the exceptionally fine work of Caity Lotz commands attention.
Some movies you find yourself liking despite of their mistakes, and this 2013 movie filmed in Wales is one of those movies.
The Machine asks all the right questions yet does so without any heavy-handiness.
Machine retains a dynamic presence, with interesting futureworld ideas sharply realized by writer/director Caradog W. James, who submits quite a cinematic vision for next to no production money.
A low-budget sci-fi thriller with worthwhile questions about the relationship between human beings and super-intelligent robots.
Beware, the Manchurian android!
More of a success than the hapless Transcendence comes close to achieving.
an ambitious project that has a slick production design and solid special effects
It may look rather serious, but underneath The Machine's shiny and po-faced exterior is an enjoyable, silly little B-movie.
The bleak chic of this SF drama is intriguing, but the script that starts out smart and elegant soon slips into the shoddy and familiar.
James overflogs the what-is-the-nature-of-being-dead horse, but directs with brio. Meanwhile, Lotz, with her child-like fragility and snappy kickboxing moves, is eminently watchable.
There are tritenesses, but particles of promise too, in Caradog James's The Machine, a low-fi sci-fi thriller from Britain.
