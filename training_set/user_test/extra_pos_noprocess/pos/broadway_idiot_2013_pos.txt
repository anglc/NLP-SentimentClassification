Hamilton can't go too far wrong because American Idiot is such a killer collection of songs.
A fast-paced, thoroughly entertaining if hardly trenchant show biz documentary ...
A pleasant if predictable documentary ...
"Broadway Idiot" is entertaining enough. Certainly if you're a Green Day fan, it's something close to essential. But it never goes too deeply into anything.
A tuneful, revealing, but superficial and undramatic documentary account of taking Green Day's "American Idiot" to Broadway.
Vibrant & colorful. The documentary emphasizes the positive and tends to gloss over any backstage tensions. Still, it is a fine testament to a great modern musical.
A film about both [creative] challenges and choices... Broadway Idiot does a good job of tapping into the source material's thick veins of feeling.
Perhaps the highest compliment I can pay the film is to say this: I really want to see American Idiot on stage now.
There are some emotionally stunning and candid moments in this documentary, and they unfold without seeming forced or staged.
