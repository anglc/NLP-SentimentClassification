Ultimately, the film rides on Frost, who carries it with charm, grace and plenty of heart.
There's nothing groundbreaking in "Cuban Fury," but it's a pleasant diversion starring the always amiable Nick Frost, with Chris O'Dowd relishing his role as a slimeball.
"Luckily, (Nick Frost has) still got enough charm to make most of us overlook the more far-fetched and dumber story elements. And surprisingly, he's fleet of foot enough to be able to pull off some pretty tricky moves and sequences."
Rooting for Frost is easy, and that goes a long way toward sustaining Cuban Fury's palatability.
What Frost lacks in grace on the ballroom floor -- and he's not bad, mind you -- is more than compensated for by the joyful expression on his face when he's tripping the light fantastic
Nick Frost amuses as a salsa-dancing fool, even if he has no chemistry with co-star Rashida Jones.
For a film that seems to stem from a single joke - i.e. "a fat guy dances salsa??" - Cuban Fury proves to be bright, brisk, and golden.
The film has enough charm and energy to subvert diminished expectations.
Not to put too fine a point on it, but Rashida Jones' freckles are one of the great, underappreciated special effects of twenty-first-century motion pictures.
Though it's all very familiar, the movie also has plenty of warm, tingly energy and many genuine laughs, not to mention some great, exciting dance sequences. It seems like a sure bet for a good date movie.
It's not the most original screenplay, but it's rather sweet and quite funny.
