"New World" is both less bloody and more thoughtful than most of its genre, the shifting-alliances plot becoming more engrossing as it progresses.
No one in American movies has made a crime opera this good in years.
Writer-director Hoon-jung Park tells this twisty story of internecine warfare within a Korean corporate crime syndicate with patience, elegance and no small amount of bloodshed.
While Park Hoon-jeong's gangster film seems to celebrate the genre rather than adding a whole lot, it's reflective of a self-conscious style that's helping South Korean directors turn a few heads.
Tense, dark, violent and brilliantly acted, if New World is any indication of what's in store for the future of the Asian cop drama; harder, sharper, yet finessed and even elegant, then carry on Korea.
Living up to the core of the noir tradition, New World takes a long view of the human species and dissects us with the cold, surgical blade of a laboratory scientist.
Smart, sharp entertainment that meets expectations dead on...if you've been looking for another The Departed-esque movie to keep you guessing, this would be a good place to start.
New World is just an intense crime thriller that is solid from beginning to end no matter how you look at it.
However familiar its moves may sometimes be, New World continually punches above its weight and that's true even when the screen isn't filled with black-suited extras assaulting each other with knives and baseball bats.
