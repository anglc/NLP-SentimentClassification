Basically a glamorized DVD extra, but it entertains.
Mr. Romero, manifesting a self-effacing demeanor and sensible humanity, is a most agreeable raconteur.
Kuhns makes time for political insights, provocative montages of race riots cut with the movie's hick militia, and the comments of owlish Romero himself, who recounts the shoot like the enthusiastic 27-year-old he was.
What distinguishes this doc from much of the tedious critical prose Romero has inspired is the fan-boy and fan-girl ardor that fuels its smarts - both behind and in front of the camera.
Rob Kuhns's amusing but perfunctory documentary about the origins of the 1968 ur-text of zombiedom, George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead."
Birth of the Living Dead does not uproot the order of behind-the-scenes documentaries, but the great likelihood that this film will send viewers right back to Romero's original with eyes reopened is a mark of its considerable success.
A reminder that this zombie flick was as much a product of its time as "Easy Rider" or "The Graduate".
Sweet and simple, Birth of the Living Dead is a nostalgic, informative trip back to the origins of the modern zombie, featuring a George A. Romero who is as spry and entertaining as ever.
What works here is enthusiasm, enjoying a wealth of appreciation presented to a worthy production, reinforcing its status as a groundbreaking picture that reverberates to this day.
Ultimately, Birth Of The Living Dead is little more than a glorified DVD featurette, but it's the kind of featurette that most Romero fans probably wouldn't mind watching more than once.
The film is unavoidably slight, but there's a certain pleasure in watching talented people wax passionate about a common source of inspiration.
Sheds light on Dead's own strange parallel journey from grindhouse to born-again arthouse immortal classic. And these voracious monsters embodying collective social anxieties in reality, and related back biting, dog-eat-dog capitalism's creepy context.
You don't need to be a fan of zombie movies to appreciate this documentary.
Birth of a Zombie-Loving Nation. Insightful, funny.
The Birth of the modern zombie film wasn't scary. It was downright hilarious, according to this smart new doc.
A short but sweet look at an iconic cinema masterpiece...
The movie appreciates that 'Night of the Living Dead' is the Bo Diddley beat of horror -- the iteration that launched a million copycats.
At 73, Romero himself is still a hoot, making me think a full documentary on the man and his career is long overdue.
An engaging doc that merits its existence both from the legitimate perspective of academic-leaning film historians as well as more casual horror fans.
