If The Raid 2: Berandal doesn't end up as the most violent movie to hit screens in 2014, it won't be for lack of trying.
Two and-a-half hours may seem like a lot for an Indonesian crime saga, but "The Raid 2" has a sweeping scope that justifies its running time. And it will knock you out.
A brilliant, dazzling, and devastating 21/2-hour ballet of brutality that's more ordeal than entertainment ...
For those of us who believe the prime directive of action pictures is that such movies ought to, by gawd, move , Gareth Evans is our new patron saint.
At once messy and adrenalizing ...
A very talented, very long piece of ultra-violence about a fleet-footed undercover cop who wreaks havoc on the criminal hierarchy of Jakarta.
The last half hour alone ranks it as one of the best martial arts films ever made.
A fantastic follow up that opens up the original film's narrative while standing on its own as a unique and brilliant action entry.
Quite possibly the 'Godfather' of martial arts films.
This time, the action scenes spring organically from the narrative, which makes them richer and more urgent.
While it may be reasonable to ask what our enjoyment of viciously violent movies says about us... it's hard to imagine anyone being left unimpressed by the sheer ingenuity of ... The Raid 2
"If you're able to withstand its extreme assault on your senses (at least visually), the thrilling, action-packed film is definitely worth a look."
Stylishly shot, edited with a lot of confidence in the audience's ability to follow parallel action, and ... faster and more brutal than anything else on the market.
How 'The Raid 2' ever earned an R rating is beyond me. I've seen NC-17 fare that wasn't half this graphic. This is one of the most violent films ever made. (Think Martin Scorsese and Sam Peckinpah to the 10th power.)
'The Raid 2' is the 'Super Mario Bros. 3' of action movies. Longer, better, more varied and just a total blast.
A very slight improvement on its disappointing predecessor...
The subtitled "The Raid 2" is in Indonesian, Japanese, Arabic and, briefly, English. But its action and drama translate to any language. It fights its way to the top of this year's action movies.
When over-the-top is not enough
When it comes to the down-and-dirty action that results from all that plotting, this undercover cop rules. And so does the movie.
By the time you emerge from The Raid 2's mind-boggling, show-stopping and utterly exhausting succession of brawls, gun battles, car chases and martial arts showdowns, you'll feel as bruised and battered as Iko Uwais' inexpressive character Rama.
The carnage is eye-gougingly savage - not for nothing does one of the hero's most lethal adversaries go by the name Hammer Girl - but Evans choreographs the action so tightly and films it so fluidly that the mayhem is mesmerising.
After the linear kick of 2011's surprise Indonesian hit The Raid, Welsh filmmaker Gareth Evans is back with an epic-style sequel that sags under the weight of its ambitions.
