On paper, About Last Night is a third-generation copy of David Mamet's 1974 stage play Sexual Perversity in Chicago -- but if anything... it comes closer to Mamet's rancorous vision of dueling hormones than the '80s screen version did.
While this version lacks the subtlety of the original, it delivers enough raunchy humor to be far more entertaining.
The 2014 model of About Last Night... it beefs up the girl-side element of the story, incorporates considerably more frank sex talk, and generally provides its cast with a lot more meat to chew on and spit back out.
Mostly, Hart aces his many showcase moments, not so much stealing the movie as occasionally letting the other actors possess it for a while.
his film has the looseness of a movie made of outtakes -- but they mostly work, and they mostly involve Hall and Hart. They're the undercard that takes over the movie.
Hart and Hall are downright lovable, their individual live wire comic energies even further elevated in the face of a formidable foil--and that resulting charge also translates into an appropriately volatile and exciting erotic electricity.
It becomes a bit repetitive but has an energy missing from many romantic comedies plus some proper laughs.
Drops enough kernels of hard truth into the romcom popcorn box to break a tooth or two.
Regina Hall and Kevin Hart steal the movie from the "stars" and keep the laughs coming
Sexy, witty and romantic, 'About Last Night' is a remake of the 1986 Edward Zwick film adapted from David Mamet's 'Sexual Perversity in Chicago,' a stage play. The 1986 movie and this one both are rated R, but this one has more steam in its dialogue.
a well-made film with the new script adapted perfectly to its cast
Plenty smart and entertaining, and in an era where cinematic romances tend to wade in the shallow end of the pool, that's a notable accomplishment.
There probably weren't a lot of people clamoring for an About Last Night remake, but this one is fresh enough to hold up well on its own.
