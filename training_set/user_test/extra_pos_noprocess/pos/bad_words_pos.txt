Almost unrelenting in its takedown both of an American institution and the country's obsession with victories big and small, Bad Words is more misanthropic fantasy than satiric fiction.
Trashy, ribald laughs in the Bad Santa vein, this marks Bateman's directorial debut; it's not much to look at, but at least he has the nerve to push the insolence, profanity, and brutal insult humor to its absolute limits.
While Bad Words is only sporadically funny, Bateman throws himself into the role without shame or ego. The film is also his directing debut, and a very capable one.
...a withering send-up of our kid-obsessed culture, in which childhood has been reimagined as a procession of parent-directed accomplishments.
[Allison Janney's] presence on any show or movie ultimately has a kind of 'Poochie' effect: whenever she's not on screen you just expect everyone else to be wondering, "Where's Janney?", hoping that somehow spirits her back.
Bad Words is a worthwhile -- if predictable -- dark comedy, particularly for those with a somewhat cruel sense of humor.
Bateman...is one of those actors whose immense warmth can't be concealed no matter how disagreeable the character and he manages...to keep the fraying edges...forgivable.
Bad Words does to spelling bees what Bad Santa did to Christmas phoniness.
If profanity bothers you, don't even read any further. Not that you'll see profanity here. It's just that 'Bad Words' isn't your kind of movie. And just because it stars many children, don't even consider taking your kid to it.
'Bad Words' calls to mind 'Bad Santa' ... not quite as good good, but it's a lot of fun.
In a word, "Bad Words" is H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S!
Underneath Bad Words' thick layer of sardonicism and snark, there is heart. You just have to dig deep. Very deep.
After seeing Bad Words, I'm trying to set up a swearing bee between Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jason Bateman.
If you take this as, in a sense, a dirty fairy tale, it is absolutely hilarious. If you take it straight you're going to have a terrible time. You're also going to be missing the point.
Bateman's directorial debut is solid. He seems on sure footing behind the camera. If only he had been up to suppressing the nice guy within, "Bad Words" could have achieved a distinctive level of satire and black humor.
