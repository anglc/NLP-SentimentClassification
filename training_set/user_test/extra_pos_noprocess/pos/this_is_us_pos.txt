The fact is that they are as criminally cute as a basketful of puppies. This Is Us manages to frame that boyish appeal astutely ...
It might not make you a fan of One Direction, but it will certainly make you understand the group, which is the job of any good documentary.
The film is a successful witness to the great charm possessed by all five members of One Direction.
With a group so evidently versed in the visuals of rock history, it's a shame that a filmmaker wasn't hired who would pay homage to classic pop films instead of offering a satisfactory paid promotional.
The boys are very likable, but the film around them is still very repetitive.
What's super-odd about this film is its director, Morgan Spurlock. Best-known as an activist documentarian...it's a bit of a shock to see his controversy-magnet name attached to something so tame, formulaic and corporate.
Background graphics burst past the stage and into the foreground - a flashy, amusingly distracting gimmick that feels true to the band it accompanies.
Perhaps the nicest surprise of the doco is that, despite emerging from the manufactured pop machine, these boys feel refreshingly grounded and they're not taking their success for granted.
One Direction: This Is Us... doesn't bother with bummers, even small ones. Fame, according to this movie, is a journey to the center of radness.
Spurlock makes inventive use of 3-D technology. The picture is trippy in places, making it more pleasant to sit through the forgettable songs than it otherwise would be. But Beatles comparisons? Please. One Direction is less a band than a business plan.
It's a superficial publicity piece. But it's enjoyable even if you're not a pre-pubescent girl.
A glossy, promotional concept that's overly enhanced by unnecessary amplification.
While this documentary may be as carefully constructed as the band, no amount of stage management can stop genuine emotions seeping through, and you're likely to find your cynicism crumbling in the face of the lads' sheer energy and down-to-earth charm.
