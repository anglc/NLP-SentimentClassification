The Conspiracy does more with a found-footage conceit than any horror movie since The Blair Witch Project.
Continually surprises and engages the viewer even when it's falling apart.
A satisfying found-footage spooker.
As both a compelling examination of conspiracy theorists and a unique found footage film, The Conspiracy lays firm groundwork before delivering a tense, dynamic third act.
Like any good conspiracy theorist (or perhaps Grand Master of the Universe), MacBride rewrites the cosmos, forcing us either to buy the particular reality that he's peddling, or to risk being cast as collusive shills or sacrificial 'sheeples'.
The Conspiracy walks like a doc and talks like a doc, but don't be fooled; it's actually a clever piece of fiction. At least, given the subject matter, I hope that's all it is.
