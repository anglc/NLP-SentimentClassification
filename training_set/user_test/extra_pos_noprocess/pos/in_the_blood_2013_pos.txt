The closed-quarters combat crackles with bone-shattering believability. And that's really all that matters.
Carano, a former mixed-martial artist, won't be vying for an Oscar any time soon but she can more than hold her own as an action star. She deserves a bigger canvas on which to show off her skills.
I'm convinced Stockwell just sits around his Top Gun mansion reading scripts until he finds one containing the magical combination of cerulean water and two piece swimsuits.
Saddled with a weirdo, disturbing ending. Still, there's still a certain ramshackle appeal to this starchy, Taken-meets-Turistas revenge flick, which could just as easily be titled Woman on Fire.
"In the Blood" will appeal to fans of "Taken" -- a lone warrior with a set of skills who tears apart a foreign land to find a loved one. Justice is served, but at a very bloody price.
Whatever you do, don't ever, EVER go ziplining.
Go in knowing the film will deliver on butt-kicking Carano, but not much else and you'll be perfectly satisfied.
