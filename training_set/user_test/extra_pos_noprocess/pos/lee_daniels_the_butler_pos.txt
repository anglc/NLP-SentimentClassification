The Butler proves a decent, significant, but slightly stodgy affair. Its dignified restraint stifles its anger.
A high-minded, didactic, but irresistible entertainment ...
Forest Whitaker imbues his part with immense dignity and the old-age makeup is effective showcasing Cecil during his later years.
[A] turbulent, emotionally overpowering movie.
Winfrey is good, though, demonstrating yet again that she's an actress and not just a celebrity playing an actress.
A large-scale, middle-of-the-road work that is entertaining and moving in the way that many other movies about the struggle for race equality have been.
The Butler is as worthy and earnest as its hero... but some scenes have a gut-wrenching impact that makes the struggle to overcome bigotry and oppression heartrendingly real.
A deeply moving melodrama about a subtly subversive black butler at the heart of the White House. You will need Kleenex.
It's a heart-warming tale simply told.
The best film of 2013 (paired with "12 Years a Slave").
It's a veritable star-spangled jamboree. And through it all, Whitaker keeps his powder admirably dry ...
Think of it as a Trojan horse. Apparently harmless, it takes key myths about the land of the free and inflicts an impressive amount of damage.
As the beating heart of this story about "a crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice", Whitaker is back on form.
The Butler provides a well-paced look at the fluctuating and often shocking socio-political landscape of the 20th Century...
Has all the bells and whistles one could want from a big, fat Oscar-baiting picture.
What makes this film worth seeing, above all else, is the remarkable, grade A cast-list.
It may be a tad schematic but it's never less than absorbing and beautifully acted by a strong cast, including Oprah Winfrey as Cecil's troubled, lonely wife.
This is an strangely slushy movie from Lee Daniels, whose last two films bristled with unexpected life. By contrast, this star-packed drama uses a true story to trace the Civil Rights struggle from the 1950s to the present day.
