This quietly affecting indie film, about a Middle East war vet and the 10-year-old boy he takes under his wing, gently pulls the heartstrings while making dramatic missteps along the way.
The top notch production qualities, great direction, and fantastic ensemble performances make this film a definite recommendation.
Excels in performances resonating with raw intensity and dramatic authenticity. But while earnestly inspired by the tragic circumstances facing US soldiers in war for real, the material forming the basis here is without historical context, and it shows.
It all ends on a grace note that feels false but caps an otherwise solid if predictable drama.
