Inspiring story of a boy's efforts to help homeless kids.
A double whammy about the crusade of a big-hearted boy who helps homeless children and a depiction of the plunge of a mother and her son into poverty.
Not many 14-year-olds have movies made about their lives. Zach Bonner is an exception, always has been, and that's why Little Red Wagon is such a sweetly inspiring story.... It's a nice movie, probably too much so for viewers seeking meatier drama.
The filmmakers never sentimentalize their story and the performances are first-rate. What could be cloying is played out honestly... and not just its good intentions.
