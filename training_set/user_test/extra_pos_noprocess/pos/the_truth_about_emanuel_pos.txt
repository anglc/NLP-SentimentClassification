Part coming-of-age drama, part offbeat psychological thriller, The Truth About Emanuel does not entirely pull off its unusual story but is well worth watching for the spark generated by leads Kaya Scodelario and Jessica Biel.
Though its twist comes early, the payoff has a surprisingly strong emotional impact.
An odd, sensitive affair, with Skins graduate Scodelario impressive in her American debut.
For those with more interest in the mental decay of trauma and troubling defense mechanisms, Emanuel steps carefully and finds the occasional note of profundity to articulate the awakening taking place.
It runs out of steam, but the actresses are worth watching.
