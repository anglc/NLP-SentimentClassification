The crescendo of two resonant careers makes the false notes of "Unfinished Song" forgivable.
Shamelessly sentimental, cute to a fault, but the acting is first-rate.
The gentle story of a marriage, and of how music can help make a broken heart whole again.
Unfinished Song is full of predictably poignant moments; you'd be lucky to survive the film dry-eyed.
[A] modest, tear-jerking charmer ... Just don't expect too much more than what shows on its paint-by-numbers surface.
Vanessa Redgrave and Terence Stamp and those voices - their solos contain this picture like carved book-ends, vintage and lovely and still so profoundly of use.
Stamp and Redgrave elevate adequate material into something special every time they share the screen. Be forewarned that the musical number that closes the film is guaranteed to have you reaching for the Kleenex.
The simple fact is that Unfinished Song works on nearly every level -- thanks in large part to the presence of Terence Stamp and the always remarkable Vanessa Redgrave.
Inspiring & genuinely moving. Terence Stamp gives an all-time best, Oscar-worthy performance.
Unfinished Song is easy to swallow and entirely void of awkward lumps. It even nourishes the soul at some base level thanks to the superlative performances from the highly laurelled cast.
It boasts two beautiful performances from Terence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave.
Simplistic, but blessedly so, Song is only out to warm up its audience, inducing tears and smiles as three actors keep the production palatable despite its serious lean toward a manipulative disaster.
Unfinished Song is shameless hokum, but it should please its target audience.
If Mr. Holland's Opus and the senior singers documentary Young@Heart had a baby, this would be it.
Terence Stamp is a rock star.
