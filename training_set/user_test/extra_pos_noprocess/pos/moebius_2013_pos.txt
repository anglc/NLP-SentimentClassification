[Moebius] would be easy to dismiss if Kim weren't so sincere and sober in pursuit of his Oedipal and other emotional concerns.
It's one from the heart, and a twisted tale it is.
Such is Kim's plotty momentum that the whole thing feels like an extreme joke made of pained silences, one that somehow strips bare the subtext of overbearing parents.
Moebius is almost weird enough to be a creation myth, and that's no small accomplishment.
The clever twists in the story are captivating enough to compensate for the disgusting nature of the acts on-screen.
[Kim Ki-duk] peppers his film's nastiness with baroque humour.
Even by Kim's extreme standards, Moebius maintains such a pitbull hold on its straight-world targets that it enters a shadowy realm of post-subversion.
Moebius marks another feature to come from an innovative director who manages to live up to expectation, and yet at the same time, he never fails to compel and surprise.
So let the viewer beware: Moebius' rubbernecking appeal is hard to resist, but you run the risk of winding up feeling like a mouse caught in the hypnotic snare of a snake's unblinking gaze.
A kind of silent opera in which the actors' precise facial emoting and a muscular editing rhythm create a melodrama by turns horrific and hilarious.
There's mischievous humour here - and, oddly, grace, right up to the enigmatic Buddhist sign-off.
A dark and thoroughly depraved odyssey of sexual desire that strongly plays to Kim's preoccupation towards unusual, psychosexually informed chamber pieces.
Even Oedipus would be left scratching his head by this bonkers but drily funny tale of one family's forlorn search for normality.
