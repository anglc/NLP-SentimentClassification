This masterwork is set in contemporary China, where the gulf between those able to maneuver (or manipulate) the country's economies of change and those left behind or defeated by the seismic shifts widens.
In two decades of moviemaking, China's Jia Zhangke has examined the damage of his country's explosive growth with a poetic sense of outrage. With his latest effort, the implied violence bubbles over.
Jia is passionate about his characters, but that never compromises his considerable artistic control.
Drawing on four news stories, writer-director Jia Zhangke portrays the plight of workers in the new China. Set in four provinces, A Touch of Sin is humanist critique of the country's turn to capitalism.
Jia offers a stark presentation (no music, few edits) that discourages vicarious thrills; the violence is startling, not cool.
Jia's primary concern here is the solitary suffering of his characters, punished to the point where they can't take anymore.
It's a movie that's bitterly violent, both physically and emotionally, and a tremendous exploration of the have-nots in a society that is mostly known for its haves.
It might be my least favorite of (Jia's) movies, but I still count it as one of the best films of 2013 which should tell you what I think of this extraordinary filmmaker.
It's a brilliant lyrical film, shot on a grand-scale.
Though ultra-violent at times, those in the market for quality arthouse fare are guaranteed to be enthralled.
It's that quality of directness, of purpose -- here particularly fierce purpose -- that gives Jia's plays with fiction and nonfiction both their vigour and their political perceptiveness and bite.
Teases together four disparate stories of people driven to violence by the purgatorial pain of their modern existence.
Jia Zhangke's brilliantly observed A Touch of Sin paints a bleak and violent picture of a contemporary China in which corruption is endemic.
It provides a brutal, compelling insight into a troubled nation and is told with a fierce sense of urgency.
It's been banned in China for its savage criticism of that nation's economic and social policies. But its horrors look awfully familiar to us in the West, too.
Shocking. Stylish. Historic.
Consistently gripping and fascinating.
The violence hits you like a shovel to the head, but the political rage stings hardest.
This is what Pulp Fiction might have looked like if Bill Douglas had got hold of it.
There's more than a nod to King Hu's Touch Of Zen as Zhangke unleashes a four-fisted chunk of ultraviolent fury. Tarantino would approve.
It's a strikingly shot picture with some genuine dramatic weight, but as an overall piece of understanding, the movie leaves too much obscured, keeping the viewer in the dark despite some incredibly intimate acts of deliberation.
This major work is cinematic in scope but loses none of the provocative truth that defines Zhangke's oeuvre.
I can't imagine a comparable American movie, militating passionately, lyrically over on the economic inequities of American life. It just isn't done.
[A] bracing and unexpected offering from a director we thought we knew.
The filmmaker uses his trademark meditative pacing to delineate a de facto Wild West replete with ruthless corruption.
