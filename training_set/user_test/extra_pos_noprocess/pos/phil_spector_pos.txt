The film is an engrossing drama, with a dazzling performance by Al Pacino in the title role.
The movie broadens from Spector's legal case into larger explorations of prejudices people can harbor about celebrities and eccentrics. The result is a thoughtful, sometimes fascinating, purposefully inconclusive character study.
Pacino seldom fails to cut straight to the soul of a character who is both brilliant and pathetic.
Mamet fails to present an overwhelming case, but it's just enough.
