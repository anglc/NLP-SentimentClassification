It's well acted and gorgeously and tenebrously shot.
The film pits their honest passion against the stylized desperation of the actress' religious theater and the decadent hollowness of Berlusconi's political theater.
If "Dormant Beauty" does not rank among Mr. Bellocchio's best movies, it nonetheless still occasionally shows him at his best.
Unlike most movies that rely on TV-news reports to drive the story, Dormant Beauty is complex and humane, and never shrinks to mere spectacle.
Though the movie eschews facile sloganeering, few of its characters or narrative threads are able to develop beyond their function as metaphors.
Swift and often compelling, it's also blessedly unbiased.
"Dormant Beauty" is well-written, beautifully performed, and nicely made, if a good 15 minutes overlong. But we couldn't help but feel, given how controversial it proved in advance, that it should've been willing to go a little closer to the edge.
Bellocchio may sometimes shut these characters in their rooms, but his view of them all is as open in mind and spirit as a film can be.
Despite the awkward narrative structure, the choppy film serves as a welcome showcase for ably understated performances from veteran Toni Servillo and rising talent Alba Rohrwacher, and a coolly burning Isabelle Huppert.
Dormant Beauty always comes back to the difficult decisions that family members have to make for each other, contrasted with the huffiness of outsiders who try to project their own beliefs onto someone else's business.
The film puts too many elements into play, which means it ends up darting hopelessly between a series of underdeveloped storylines.
Not an advocacy film in the conventional sense but one that deals with the ethical and spiritual paradoxes of Italy's version of the Terri Schiavo controversy. Brilliant filmmaking as always from Bellocchio.
The Vesuvius of social-psychological potboilers. All the screaming and twice the anguish of the average Italian movie.
