The result may not be a big movie, but Things Never Said makes a big emotional impact.
A powerful statement about the plight of women held back by sexist tyranny.
The movie's poems are unambiguous rants, delivered with theatrical ferocity. On-the-nose dialogue propels its lessons in self-respect.
Veteran TV writer Charles Murray (Third Watch) shows his small-screen roots by overrelying on tense, weighty exchanges to advance the narrative, but Hampton's steely performance makes them pay off, as the poet learns to wrest truth from pain.
The familiar themes of escaping abuse and self-actualization/redemption/salvation through art become, in Murray and his cast's hands, something uniquely and memorably moving and exhilarating.
The kind of film that Hollywood rarely makes anymore: smart, deep, honest, genuinely poignant and complex. It will nourish your heart, mind and soul. Shanola Hampton delivers a bravura, star-making performance.
