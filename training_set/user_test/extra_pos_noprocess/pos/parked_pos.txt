This engaging character study functions best as a two-hander: The male leads build a wholly believable, offbeat co-dependency, while their interactions with others tend toward the more generic.
[An] elegant, engaging meditation on displacement and the modern man.
Strong performances bolster a dodgy scenario in homeless drama.
Infused with the visceral impact of raw truth connected to the homeless insider point of view looking out at a callous world. But when it comes to the director's outside looking in perspective, there's a second hand sense of little felt or endured.
My nominee for the saddest film of the year.
A remarkable Irish drama about a homeless man living in his car whose friends help him get unstuck.
It veers rather widely through strains of comedy, melodrama and crime-thriller, but it's very well made, consistently engaging and surprisingly moving.
Packing two terrific turns and an offbeat spirit, this coming-of-middle-age comedy is an unexpected treat.
