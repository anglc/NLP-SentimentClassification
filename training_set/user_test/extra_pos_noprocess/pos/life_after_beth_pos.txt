Though it stumbles in some cases, "Life After Beth" is a solid zombie romance with some real teeth to it.
Plaza steals the show with one foot in the grave, her rotting heroine ricocheting between adolescent snarkiness and cadaverous rage, a lethal combination of which no one around her has the measure.
Good effort. Great actors. But a missed opportunity.
While zombie rom-coms aren't original (see Shaun of the Dead or Warm Bodies), this take on the genre has such a deadpan tone that it feels refreshingly unpredictable.
An inventive zombie comedy with a surprising degree of charm.
It's an age-old story. Boy loses girl. Boy finds girl. Boy realises girl is undead.
Does deliver some fun undead action, yet the laughs are never as big as you'd hope.
We must surely now be getting close to some sort of zombie saturation point, with even the zomromcom becoming a distinct subsubgenre. On Beth's evidence, however, there's life in the undead yet.
If our undead loved ones ever do rise, hopefully we'll feel the same mix of joy and terror as Zach in this sad and sweet romzomcom.
Life After Beth finds a fresh angle to work and the right cast to work it. There's death in the genre yet.
A romantic-comedy to die for... It's dead funny... etc., etc. DeHaan and Plaza ace it in a sure-footed zombie movie more interested in heart than braaaaains.
...leaving aside the disappointing inevitability of the script, a gore-stained Plaza supplies us with some wonderful physical comedy, and an underused Anna Kendrick sparkles adorably.
