Gasland Part II couches its anger in the measured tones of someone who is trying to suppress that anger long enough to explain to outsiders why the situation is so outrageous.
Fox is on to something. But he's on to too much of something, and that sprawl -- which takes him from Dimock, Pa., to Dish, Texas, to Hollywood, to Queensland, Australia, to the bayou, to Washington, D.C. -- tends to dilute the story he set out to tell.
Gasland Part II is basically a film for the converted; if you didn't get the message with Gasland, you won't get it with this film.
Although overly dense and at times unfocused, "Gasland Part II" successfully continues Fox's crusade against the ill effects of natural gas.
