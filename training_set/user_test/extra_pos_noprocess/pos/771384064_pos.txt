A taut, atmospheric if not especially deep thriller ...
A below-ground but slightly above average horror movie ...
If Beneath isn't as good a movie as the nerve-shattering The Descent, well, few are. But Beneath aims for the same ambitious mix of physical and psychological terror and does a tidy job of not showing its hand until it's good and ready.
Beneath shakes off its generic trappings early on to deliver a fantastic blend of chills and thrills, and the script keeps viewers guessing in a way that never feels manipulative or cheap.
A good thriller for a dark night of Netflixing.
The cast delivers believable performances throughout.
