A keeper of a film, quietly dazzling
It's an odd, sad love story, combined with a meditation on technology as an accelerator of social loneliness. Not a small part of it seems to be an allegory of lonely guys and their fear of women.
In a dark theater, surrounded by the wondrous world Jonze creates in Her, it's difficult to avoid getting emotional.
Her shares a lot of themes with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, another story about the difficulty of moving on from relationships that once seemed destined to last forever.
Delightfully entertaining, if slightly unnerving ...
Her is a wistful, wonderful meditation on where we are and where we might be going.
A provocatively-relevant film about how technology can make people dangerously introspective.
Her explores fantastical ideas in ways we wish more films would: cerebrally, maturely, and non-reliant on action.
Her is a winning discussion of the idealization of women and the possessive nature of monogamous relationships in a somewhat warmer fashion than Vertigo or Ruby Sparks while admitting that its a problem for both genders.
While intimacy and exclusivity are the core ideas being explored, very little is taboo...'Eliza,' you've come a long way, baby.
"Her" is the finest writing and directorial endeavor of Spike Jonze's career.
This quirky, clever, thought-provoking film is an all-too-credible prediction of the way humanity is heading, but is also sharply observant of the way we interact with technology, and each other, today.
A lyrical, deeply felt movie with a surprisingly gentle spirit.
Phoenix's performance is imbued with such genuine heartsickness that Theodore's musings on why his marriage fell apart ring of piercing, real-life regret, not break-up bromides.
'Her' reduces love to a purely intellectual pursuit. The body is oddly irrelevant, the soul absent, reproduction abandoned. The result is dehumanizing. And yet fascinating.
An abundantly earnest look at the pain of loss and the rebirth of new love that somehow feels wholly original and familiar at the same time.
It's an incredible technological tale about love, human connection, and a question of a higher power.
The only other filmmaker who knows how to make sound, music and moment fit like a fitting of a perfectly suited slipper would be Sofia Coppola. Patience. Trust.
If Her is indeed a male fetish fantasy (as one journalist claimed), it's an odd one, presumably aimed at the same men who get a thrill from having their member sheathed in sandpaper.
As Her slips into an inevitable melancholy, it becomes less about trans-humanity and more about, well, humanity.
A beautiful, bewitching and deceptively warm experience.
For the first time with Her, the relationships Jonze brings to the big screen blossom into something bigger than the story and setting around them.
Witty, tender and arrestingly gorgeous, Her is a masterpiece. Phoenix's central performance is of the lofty levels we have come to expect of him while Johansson disarms with only her voice.
In a calculatedly ambiguous way, Jonze appears to be both simultaneously mocking and embracing a genre (a tactic he used previously in Adaptation).
Audacious gimmicky sci-fi romance story between a lonely divorced writer with his newly purchased OS1.
A film you can revisit time and time again.
