In a single sequence, Aronofsky combines creationism, Darwinian evolution, original sin, the end of days, and radical environmentalism.
For all the high-tech showmanship on display, this retelling of Noah and the Ark marks a serious effort to engage with the Old Testament as a literary text.
In some ways, Noah resembles one of those Kirk Cameron movies about the apocalypse, only with a better cast and more dazzling special effects.
Darren Aronofsky's film about the Old Testament shipbuilder has been sparking controversy - but there's no denying that the Great Flood, digitized, is a pretty great flood.
Darren Aronofsky's Noah was the most exciting big-budget studio film of 2014. While comic book movies are all the rage, Aronofsky's Noah treats the great flood as the ultimate origin story: the origin of life as we know it.
Noah isn't exactly the epic that bible-thumpers wished for, but Aronofsky's vision is masterful enough to create truly mesmerizing moments without being swept away by the murky waters of blockbuster boredom.
This is an epic that could easily have gotten lost in spectacle, but Aronofsky has managed to balance things just right, making for a thrilling and touching cinematic experience.
Aronofsky manages to transform a story, hokey on paper and even on reflection, into a spiritual flood-saga that's pretty damned immersive and elemental in its power.
Noah manages to be both reverent and action-conscious, but not strongly either one.
It ranges far, wide and clumsily in expanding its slender source material, but Noah aches with aspiration, its sincerity and ambition virtually leaping off the screen.
It's ultimately clear that the movie could've lost half of its running time without sacrificing any of its important story and character beats...
It's certainly not the sometimes-whimsical Bible story that's told to so many children. Director Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah' is a drama about a tormented man determined to do God's bidding and about people who are ravaging the earth.
Aronofsky's grand, crazy vision is filled with more awe and reverence than a traditional snoozefest like Son of God, and, in its fun, flawed and chaotic way, Noah is a popcorn flick about the endless wonders of the universe and of the human soul.
Darren Aronofsky upends convention-but stays true to the bible-with this controversial epic.
Pro-vegan and anti-industrial messages aside... as (a) non-Biblical, alternative history version of the Great Flood, there's some interesting stuff going on here.
There is so much here that is wonderful and strange, my problems with the film are not much more than quibbles. ... I think Noah is Darren Aronofsky's Take Shelter.
Add Darren Aronofsky's "Noah" to the list of Bible-themed film epics ranging from magnificent to stuffy to silly.
An auteurist monument to monomania inspired by Judeo-Christian culture's most famous report of a divine reboot..
A bold, trippy new interpretation of an old, old story, about miracles of varying size and shape, in which we still today might find some new angles of inspiration.
