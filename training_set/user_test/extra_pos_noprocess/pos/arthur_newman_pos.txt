A strange film about dysfunctional people directed with good pace by Dante Ariola in his feature film debut highlighted by fine performances by Colin Firth and Emily Blunt.
Firth and Blunt give life (and flawless American accents) to this restrained, and occasionally bland, road trip flick.
Firth's performance alone would have been enough to hail this film by director Dante Ariola. Toss in an equally powerful performance by Blunt, and the film turns to a masterwork of acting.
Often-somber drama has language, sex, drinking.
