In its way, this is the most terrifying horror movie I've seen in a long time; the woods where the kids die are like something out of Evil Dead. I was left angry and wrung out.
It is really down to Egoyan's cast to find a way to connect with the viewer on a personal level. Thankfully, one and all are more than up to the task.
I actually did think there were some powerful scenes early on in the film and I do think Reese Witherspoon and Colin Firth are really fine in it.
