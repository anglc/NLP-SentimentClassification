In the end, Come Morning succeeds on the strength of a simple narrative with personal dynamic complexities that reveal themselves slowly.
It isn't for everyone, and it certainly won't be considered one of the feel-good movies of the year, but if you appreciate beautiful cinematography and a well-crafted story that still leaves space for thought, Come Morning is an absolute must-see.
...a taut, atmospheric and, given its budgetary restraints, extraordinarily well-realized suspense film set and filmed in southern Arkansas near Kingsland. It's a fine example of what can be accomplished outside a studio paradigm.
