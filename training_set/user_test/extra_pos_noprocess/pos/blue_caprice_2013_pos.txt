Coolly controlled and extremely well-acted.
Spare yet deeply atmospheric, the film is charged with dreadful fatalism.
The film creates one of the most chillingly becalmed portraits of insanity I've seen.
This lyrical, frightening film is a portrait of a man consumed by self-hatred who decided to take it out on the world.
The film's a character piece with a tightening noose of suspense, and while it has its artsy-indie-dawdly moments, it's disturbing in ways that aren't easy to shake.
...a half-baked endeavor that's unable to entirely live up to the promise of its setup and stellar performances.
It may be too much slow-burning style for those looking for true-crime substance only, but a cool patience is what drives Blue Caprice.
Blue Caprice is a fascinating character study and a fictionalized, human look at two people who went on a murderous rampage and killed innocent people for their beliefs.
This is a low-key film with a deliberate pace. It is dark and chilling in its atmosphere with danger lurking all along the way. It depicts two people on the outside looking in with anger and hunger and evil intent.
By no means a pleasant or enjoyable experience. But... it's certainly a rewarding and memorable piece of cinema.
Haunting and less than riveting, but jarring nonetheless.
Disturbing drama speculates on D.C. shooters' lives
What's fascinating is the plausibility of the education Lee receives at the hands of John, how this grim sensei inculcates him in the ways of murder, convincing him that "it's not crazy to kill people, they do it every day." J
The tension and slow poisoning of rational thought is riveting to watch, allowing the feature to find its footing as a depiction of significant exploitation viewed through a horrifying true crime lens.
The filmmakers unnervingly convey the killers' methodical yet ultimately random cruelty, and they do it without being exploitative.
Thanks to his tone poem approach and desire to evoke instead of explain, Moors makes Blue Caprice a sensational study in subtle psychopathology.
It smartly avoids trying to make some grand political statement, while also not turning the perpetrators into victims. It's more concerned with the psychology leading up to the crime than the physical violence.
In presenting no easy answers or a clear motive for the actions of our two doomed leads, Blue Caprice paints a portrait of disillusionment gone awry and a bond steeped in impending tragedy.
A compelling depiction of psychological decline.
