Intelligent, possibly important, definitely counterintuitive -- but needs more reporting and context.
Documenting how five authors changed from anti- to pro-nuke energy stances, Stone is less persuasive at translating this logic into reality.
In the end, its somewhat equivocal message - that nuclear power might just be the lesser of several evils - is more convincing than you'd think.
It's a shame so few people see documentaries, and that so few politicians pay them any attention, because this film has the power to change the way we think about nuclear energy.
Robert Stone's fascinating documentary makes a convincing case for a nuclear future.
Thoroughly engaging thanks to its strong editing and startling facts, but the film feels a little conceited thanks to its one-sided argument.
The director paints a partisan picture, but offers an eloquent and effective challenge to orthodox eco-wisdom.
This documentary, from Robert Stone, sets out to think the unthinkable and ask the unaskable: should we learn to stop worrying and love nuclear energy?
An A-grade exercise in myth-busting...Consciously counter-intuitive, Pandora's Promise is a challenging, sober film that provides much food for thought as it dares to de-demonise nuclear power.
The utter irony in which this doco is steeped is that the very same reasons - the safe preservation of earth's environment - are now driving the very same people who stood against nuclear energy ... in favour of nuclear energy
Documentary filmmaker Robert Stone goes against the popular anti-nuke stance held by our society for many years and brings with him a bevy of anti-nuke turned pro-nuke environmentalists, activists and nuclear engineers.
Pandora's Promise is a fascinating documentary about nuclear power that argues it is the true green energy. It would be hard to imagine a film more controversial than this one.
Sure, it's a little one-sided, but so are most environmental films...Whether Stone sways you or not, you can afford to give 90 minutes toward setting the balance right.
With glaciers melting, seas rising and superstorms in the wings, Pandora's Promise, despite its one-sided polemics, revives a desperately needed conversation.
Sure to raise eyebrows.
