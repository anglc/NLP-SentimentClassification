This sequel to the hit action comedy 21 Jump Street is better all around: the pacing is more consistent, the sight gags more imaginative, the self-referential jokes sharper.
22 Jump Street is hardly fresh, but the picture has enough energy to get by.
22 Jump Street is pretty much the exact same movie as 21 Jump Street. It knows it, you know it, and it knows that you know it. And that is why it's brilliant.
Self-referential irony is hardly a new gimmick, having served as the underlying premise for such franchises as Scream and Austin Powers, but rarely has it been indulged with such fervor.
Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's second-best film of the year (behind The Lego Movie).
Filmmakers Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who are themselves impressive partners at this point) know enough not to mess with a successful formula.
Magnificently stupid with flashes of brilliance. "22 Jump Street" is a zany action comedy that fizzles a bit at the end, but generates enough laughter to make it a very worthwhile sequel.
While "22 Jump Street" may not be quite as funny as its predecessor, it still manages to deliver a multitude of laughs over its stretched runtime, all while using pretty much the same premise.
If there's a funnier comedy this year, it'll have to be something quite special.
Despite some inevitable lulls, several scenes are as consistently funny as anything we've seen for years. And, like Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy in last year's The Heat, the dialogue between the two leads makes up for the holes in the plot.
Full of inside jokes (hey, we're making a sequel) and fantastic performances, "22 Jump Street" is everything you want in a sequel and more.
While this film is dominated by vulgar, slapstick humor, it is not exactly brain dead. There is a certain self-aware, self-mocking quality to it. It also helps that the characters are basically good guys.
This is a film that is creative enough... to mock its own lack of creativity.
Proving that sometimes the same joke is funnier the second time around, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum return for a major serving of big, broad, stupid laughs.
All you really need to know is that it's the cleverest sequel to a dumb movie of all time.
The jokes are fresh and more often than not manage to produce some big laughs.
While much of this is pretty standard stuff, it's all easy to take thanks to the engaging performances from the two leads. The screenplay contains quite a few funny lines, and the direction by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller is crisp and efficient.
Subversively satisfying, if senselessly silly sequel.
In fact, much of the bawdy humor in 22 Jump Street comes from its makers' staunch refusal to take anything about the venture seriously.
In a summer of sequels, the most laughs so far, and by far, come from a raunchy retro repeat that makes plenty of fun of its own recycled folly-and expense.
Begins with a clip of a professor discussing the meaning of yin and yang, and that symbol of apparently opposing but in fact complementary forces becomes a kind of theme.
22 Jump Street is not just a sequel, it is a 112-minute running gag about sequels, including the adaptation of the title.
