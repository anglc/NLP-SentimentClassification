Freed from its ties to the source material - the first film was inspired by a Steve Harvey self-help book - Think Like a Man Too borrows liberally but in a definite PG-13 fashion from The Hangover, hitting on every required Vegas touchstone.
The sequel to Steve Harvey's hit takes us to Las Vegas, with hilarious, yet predictable and overdone scenarios.
Fans will enjoy slightly less funny, still risque sequel.
A pleasant, if predictable, diversion peppered with incessant chatter on the part of the irrepressible Kevin Hart.
