Charming perfectly describes... Toy Story of Terror!
It unwinds an engaging plot that should entertain kids and keep their parents amused.
There's much to be said for exploiting such fare judiciously. Yet given that Pixar has the superior stable of titles and their shared parentage, one can hope that ABC will have a friend in Pixar - and be "Terror!"-ized a little more often.
Another shining gem from Pixar's most endearing franchise and should be a new Halloween staple for all families.
Playing with the conventions of classic horror movies, the special cleverly incorporates them in a way that stays true to the already beloved Toy Story while also dropping them into a brand new setting.
A brief but entertaining addition to the series canon. Disney's Blu-ray release comes with an audio commentary, three more "Toy Story" short films, and a bunch of other worthwhile extras. An engaging package that is easily recommendable.
The bottom line is that this is genuine family-friendly fun (with some lovely gags aimed purely at the grown ups) and well worth it, especially if you've got Toy Story fans in the family.
If this does well enough - and it deserves to be huge - maybe they can all come back for another TV special. It's that good.
Shorts like Toy Story OF TERROR! give fans an opportunity to revisit the entertaining Toy Story universe and spend more time with these beloved characters.
Toy Story Of Terror succeeds as a stand alone special (it already feels like a perennial favorite like It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown) and a part of the continuous Toy Story universe.
Toy Story Of Terror is on par with the films in all categories, albeit with a much shorter installment this time around.
Horror film-themed TV special is sweet treat for families.
