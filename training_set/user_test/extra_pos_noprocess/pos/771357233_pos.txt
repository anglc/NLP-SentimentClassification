The sheer warmth and liveliness of Fiennes's Dickens means he's impossible not to like.
Fiennes and screenwriter Abi Morgan adapt Claire Tomalin's book with delicate grace, presenting love as blessing, curse and, perhaps, inevitable force.
Why did this bright, vivacious, intellectually engaged girl willingly lock herself up in a wealthy man's seraglio? Put bluntly, what did she get out of it? In the end, "The Invisible Woman" remains a mystery.
It's wonderfully cast ... and beautifully designed; a quiet pleasure.
Even if you don't entirely buy this version of events, director Ralph Fiennes has given us a speculation that works as drama. It's an elegant bit of goods.
It's unhurried yet confident, familiar yet provocative. With fine cinematography by Robert Hardy (Blitz), most 'Expectations' will, indeed, be met.
The performances are first-rate -- Fiennes and Jones are stellar, as are Kristin Scott Thomas as Nelly's mother and Tom Hollander as playwright Collins -- and the score and period details are sumptuous. But the film still drags.
The Invisible Woman is a beautiful picture with strong performances, but made unnecessarily convoluted.
The Invisible Woman is so subtle and secretive that it sets a record as the most low-keyed of its usually feverish genre.
The Invisible Woman is a fine-looking period piece and Fiennes has an eye for nuance as Dickens tries handling the public news of his private life in a world that has just discovered the thrill of newspaper gossip.
The pleasure and the drama come in watching for the real emotions peeking beneath the fancy costumes and flowery dialogue (by screenwriter Abi Morgan), all the more fierce because they must be repressed.
Solid, beautifully shot and acted, leisurely paced costume drama that can't hide ... that its central love affair is illicit. What I found fascinating was its depiction of just how an affair was run in such a situation - in those days, among such people.
The Invisible Woman is a satisfying romantic drama that explores a very complex relationship.
Felicity Jones gives a strong depiction of repressed emotion. Up against Fiennes' Dickens -- all bonhomie, energy, mercurial self-consciousness -- she's a melancholy figure.
The Invisible Woman , overall, is a film of intelligence and subtlety, and Jones's performance as Nelly reflects exactly those qualities - she brings Nelly, with all her complexities, doubts and conflicted loyalties, vividly to life.
Exquisitely directed by Fiennes, who also delivers convincingly in his portrayal of Dickens, there is a poetic quality about the film with its dreamy cinematography, ethereal music and wonderful sense of time and place
Despite being saddled with all of the demands that come with directing, Fiennes turns in one of the best performances of his career.
This is not a film about the good-hearted Christmas-loving Dickens.
Fiennes and his team recreate 19th-century England with a precision that, in its more stifling moments, rekindles memories of Merchant Ivory.
Fiennes approaches his story intelligently, and adds poetic visual flourishes to Abi Morgan's fine script.
It's Fiennes's portrayal of the complex, driven private man behind the boundless enthusiasm and charisma of Dickens's public image that makes his performance special.
Expressing much while often saying little, Jones proves once again to be a mesmerising screen presence, a performer behind whose face you can see the most complex and subtle thought processes at work.
