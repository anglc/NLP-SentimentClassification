On its own degenerate terms, the movie works.
Bullet to the Head doesn't try to adapt its star to 2013. It just pretends that we're still living in 1986. And for 91 minutes, it just about works.
The movie's titled Bullet to the Head, what the heck do you think it's going to be?
Walter Hill's Bullet to the Head is a gritty and tough throwback to times when action films were simple, fun and still considered entertaining and worth the money.
The film could be summed by its product placement for Bulleit Bourbon, treated like a rare luxury when it's actually $20 a bottle at Trader Joe's; director Walter Hill serves this inexpensive, everyday material with a serious flourish.
Walter Hill has lost none of his directorial prowess!
Stallone still mumbles the lines, but his timing is pretty good and the jokes are well done. Violent as the film is, the special effects and stunts are impressive, especially the ax fight at the end.
Stallone and Hill make the often-corny dialogue sound not only plausible but weirdly logical.
With a cracked-asphalt voice, a shaved-wildebeest hide, the veined musculature of Swamp Thing and the apparent flexibility of a tree trunk, the aging Sylvester Stallone remains a commanding, amusing and somewhat awe-inspiring screen presence.
Thanks to Hill's directorial brio and some hot-wired one liners, Stallone can still put bad folks out of their misery real fast.
This is a very violent police action film, and that is all you can expect from it.
