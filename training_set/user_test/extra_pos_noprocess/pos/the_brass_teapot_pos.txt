There's not much depth to Mosley's debut, which is based on a short story by Tim Macy. But Michael Angarano and Juno Temple are an appealing pair as John and Alice, struggling suburbanites.
What matters is how the device is used to push the characters, and The Brass Teapot does that beautifully. Since there is an unlimited source of income, Alice's imagination is really the only limit to how abusive she and John can be.
The heart of the film is in the right place and is a fun addition to the fantasy film genre.
Juno Temple and Michael Angarano are appealing, and director Ramaa Mosley keeps her dark comedy brightly paced.
Wish-fulfillment black comedy engages through its winsome (if violent) premise and highly attractive leads, but shows some strain towards the end.
The story is set up and unfolds in a very subtle, nuanced manner that enriches each reveal.
