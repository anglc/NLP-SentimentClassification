Kevin Hart's (Along Came Polly) audience loves him, but if you're not in love yet, this probably won't start the infatuation for you.
He is, maybe, a little too frenetic, too frequently at full speed. But when he gets rolling, the laugh lines come quick, one after the other, and he kills.
He tells elliptical stories that go on so long and take so many weird detours that they end up being funny even when they shouldn't be.
If you were to judge Let Me Explain purely on its performance portion, filmed at Madison Square Garden during Hart's 2012 tour, the film would merit a full extra star. But at 75 minutes, it feels too skimpy to rave over.
The laughs are frequent, with Hart's energy and timing having grown and been honed to more than fill the vast, cavernous space of Madison Square Garden.
I could have done without [the] pointless framing device, but there is some funny and highly incorrect material here.
The less said about the specifics of the act the better -- wouldn't want to spoil the punchlines -- but Let Me Explain is a notch above Hart's last concert film, 2011's Laugh at My Pain.
'Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain' is really a laugh out loud experience that one can enjoy and come back for repeat viewings.
The stories are mainly in the "b****es be crazy" category....entertaining enough, but we get a sense he can do more.
Hart's comedy is the product of a brilliant acting performance. He uses his imposing physical and vocal skills to bring a paranoid, apoplectic madwoman to hilarious, side-splitting life.
Hart, one of the most talented and successful comedians working today, can make you laugh. And laugh hard. In Let Me Explain, he's on fire.
