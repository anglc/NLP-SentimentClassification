A chaste young-adult romance that bites into supernatural melodrama, science fiction and political conspiracy theories.
Even though it may draw comparisons to Twilight, A Werewolf Boy has a more genuine demeanor with well-developed characters and an overpowering sense of benevolence.
More sensitive than sensational, 'A Werewolf Boy' is an interesting hybrid of the 'Twilight' saga, 'Frankenstein,' and 'Beauty and the Beast.' But there are touches here that make it purely Korean.
Drenched in fairy tale romance and beautifully acted with one of the screen's most charismatic teen couples, I'll take A Werewolf Boy's sweet, quiet charms over the overwrought, turgid Twilight films and their CGI puppies any day.
We'll take this warmly directed, deeply affecting supernatural romance over the entire synthetic Twilight series any day.
