The tone of the film is solemn and pious, which seems almost inevitable when the topic is segregation and racial intolerance. But there are other reasons to watch this film besides feel-good expediency.
Their story is a powerful statement about freedom.
A low-key but moving documentary about two low-key people and their moving struggle.
The film strikes a quiet, contemplative tone that befits its soft-spoken subjects rather than the tumultuous times in which they lived.
The Loving Story is a different kind of 1960s civil rights tale, one that in many ways has a deeper level of warmth.
One of the many virtues of Buirski's film is that it doesn't hit viewers over the head with the parallel between the Lovings' case and the debate over same-sex marriage.
Not to take away from the film's importance, the whole is like Richard Loving, stolid and admirable but not inspiring.
Reason both to be horrified and inspired by what people can accomplish, and a reminder that progress only happens through coordinated and relentless activism.
A riveting documentary about the case that went all the way to the Supreme Court and legalized interracial marriage in 1967.
The film's story of this Supreme Court victory lays out both its legal and moral import, and then turns back to Richard and Mildred Loving's experience.
The verite footage from the time is a real blessing and the documentary's primary cinematic attraction. The rest, though, is occasionally its technical distraction.
Perhaps the strongest aspect of Nancy Buirski's doc is that it allows the Lovings to tell their story in their own words.
A moving, must-see documentary about the demise of one of the last vestiges of segregation. Could it be more fitting that the plaintiffs in the landmark case eradicating the crime of loving a person of a different color would be named Loving!
Beautifully made, deeply inspirational documentary about one history-making couple.
Brilliant debut film about a landmark case on miscegenation, reminiscent in many ways of the struggle for gay marriage today.
