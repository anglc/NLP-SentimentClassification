If in doubt, smash everything to pieces - and be as noisy as possible.
...if you're looking for the film that makes the Transformers the real main characters and gives them the best part of the story and the best, most resonant arcs, then Age of Extinction is your ticket.
I'm not going to say that Transformers: Age of Extinction is quite "good." But it is arguably the least "bad" of the franchise.
It is frankly pointless to knock its quintessentially Bay aesthetic of massive mayhem and the equally shameless broad corniness of its humor, for all of that is clearly what the film was meant to be and dutifully delivers.
