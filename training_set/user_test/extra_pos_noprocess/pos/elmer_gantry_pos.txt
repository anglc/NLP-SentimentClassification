Brooks honors the spirit of Lewis' cynical commentary on circus-type primitive exhortation with pictorial imagery that is always pungent. He also has written dialog that is frank and biting.
With a host of fine performances, and a strong sense of period and place conveyed by John Alton's lush camerawork, there's still plenty to enjoy.
The briskly paced drama of a religious opportunist, his colleagues and his times utilizes the tools of the motion picture in expert fashion.

Lancaster and Simmons are scorching as the con artist and the evangelist who join forces in the 1920s Midwest.
The most interesting part of this movie is its use of broad strokes to mask subtle sketches and careful characterizations.
Highly recommended for fans of Lancaster or Jean Simmons, who plays the earnest young preacher who gets caught up in Gantry's web.
With a strong message, excellent satire, and even some heart, Elmer Gantry is an excellent film, and even a tad underrated.
An entertaining melodrama with memorable performances.
