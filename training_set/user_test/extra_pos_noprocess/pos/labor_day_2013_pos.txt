If you have even the tiniest cynical bone in your body, avoid. You'll find Labor Day more sugary than a cronut.
Engagingly sappy.
It's unlike anything we've seen in memory - and all the more absorbing as a result.
It dares to diverge from the current culture of cinema by opting for a small scale, an open heart, and a sincere interest in the lives of small-town Americans.
With one of Kate Winslet's most layered, resonant performances, this film is definitely worth a look, even though the indulgent filmmaking style pushes it perilously close to Nicholas Sparks-style sappiness.
See [Winslet's] name on the opening credits and it's a good bet that what's to follow will be a classy, high-end production.
There is as much to scoff at as there is to be scoffed in Labor Day, and yet I quite liked it.
A tender, nostalgic and warm 'family' drama which also quietly seethes with the threat and tension of imminent danger. Labor Day shows a new side to Jason Reitman as a filmmaker, and we like it.
Go with the flow and give in, like Adele herself, and you might be genuinely moved.
An emotionally engaging and suspenseful blend of thriller, romance and coming-of-age story with a strong script and a trio of terrific performances from Winslet, Brolin and newcomer Gattlin Griffith.
Even if it's not what you expect from the director of Juno, there is much to enjoy in the richly-detailed performances. Labor Day is anything but hard work.
Despite getting a critical hammering in the States, it turns out that romantic drama Labor Day isn't all that bad.
