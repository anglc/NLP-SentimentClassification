British director Shan Khan debuts with an exploitative but absorbing thriller on the topical subject of Muslim honor killing.
Mr. Khan displays a strong visual sense that makes pivotal scenes pop.
A partially successful hybrid of social-realist drama and escapist revenge thriller.
Aiysha Hart delivers a mesmerizing performance as a beautiful Pakistani immigrant raised in England who disgraces her family by planning an elopement with a handsome preppie Punjabi boy.
Khan's orchestration of suspense impresses; he proves especially skilled at dropping well-timed close-ups on objects that immediately add conflict to a situation ...
Shan Khan's debut feature film, Honour, is an expose of honor killings in contemporary Britain -- a reality not easily digested.
A taut thriller about honor killings that is marred by plot improbables. Saved by Paddy Considine's customary fine performance as well as a strong lead character, a young woman fighting against patriarchal chains.
The performances are pretty committed.
While it fails to reach its potential due to its identity issues, abandoning veracity in favour of thrills, Honour deserves credit for broaching such tricky subject matter...
