Musical version is edgier, not as fun as animated movie.
The good-natured show...has a winningly inclusive spirit, a fantastical appeal, and a Vaudevillian comic showmanship that evoke The Wizard of Oz (surely a conscious inspiration). [Blu-ray]
There are a few off-color lines, but those should fly right over the heads of youngsters who will be more intent on the costumes and stage action. In fact, I'd say that this musical will appeal mostly to families with younger children.
