The actors are all first-rate and the performances are fascinating, though Shelton, who shuns exposition, makes you work to figure out the interrelationships.
There's something fresh and new here, something that wasn't so dominant in [Shelton's] previous work.
Shelton is more observant than she is deep, and her filmmaking can be undisciplined, but the movie's rambling, episodic rhythms do seem in tune with the nebulous stasis that infects everyone in Abby's orbit.
There is strong character work in here, one or two genuinely touching moments, and some good laughs too.
After a couple of gimmicky transgressive comedies (Humpday and Your Sister's Sister), writer-director Lynn Shelton takes a more observant approach this time.
The semi-improvised dialogue has the juicy tang of authenticity in the hands of this highly competent cast, and the players and Shelton never sneer at the characters' new-agey beliefs.
Gentle, warmly human dramedy about a massage therapist who suddenly can't stand to touch anyone... and about how we all need more care and attention than we get. Rosemarie DeWitt is heartbreakingly lovely.
The acting in this film is superb by the entire cast. The characters are well-drawn, well-meaning and interesting. There is no real villain here.
Writer/director Lynn Shelton has yet to disappoint.
