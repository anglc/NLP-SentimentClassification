This gripping Palestinian thriller evokes Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers in its depiction of not only the psychological pressures faced by people under occupation, but the murky moral consequences of retaliating.
It's told with a stark, pitiless clarity that leaves you with fewer answers than before.
Omar is romance and thriller. Of course, trust is at the heart of the matter.
A fraught film ...
Abu-Assad offers no solutions here. Instead he paints a portrait of the daily rhythms of the occupation, an endless conflict that has seeped into every aspect of life in the West Bank.
The film works best as a straightforward melodrama set in an anything but straightforward world.
Beautifully shot, complicated, smart, and undeniably intense ... well-deserving of its place as the Palestinian nominee for this year's Best Foreign Language Film.
Doesn't provide easy answers as it builds its pressure cooker environment, putting primary attention on the personalities involved, allowing for a human perspective as it details acts of breathless survival and suffocating paranoia.
From button-pushing Palestinian writer/director Hany Abu-Assad, who gave us the inflammatory Paradise Now in 2005, comes an equally piercing, if less politically strident look at life under Israeli occupation.
Bakri gives a richly detailed performance, often allowing his stoicism to slip and reveal the confused and angry young man within.
Abu-Assad does not aim for the Dardennes' breathless immediacy. Rather, the story is laid out in a lucid, diagrammatic way, like a mathematical proof that for someone in Omar's position there are no right choices.
This is a subtle political film: one that fully dramatises a situation and lets us think out its contradictions for ourselves.
Abu-Assad is simply reflecting the ever-changing nature of his characters' daily lives in a fraught and strange environment in which betrayal has become endemic.
As in his Golden Globe-winning 2005 drama Paradise Now, Israeli filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad takes a complex, personal approach to a touchy political-religious situation in this Palestinian love story.
The end result is a nerve-rattling entertainment flavoured by vigorous, deeply felt polemic.
A tense, involving combination of love story and thriller.
The story dishes out action and surprises without losing its political intent.
Abu-Assad cares about his characters and their wretched but thrilling situations.
A shell game of betrayal and counter-betrayal set in the worlds of police informing and sectarian score-settling on either side of the Israel-Palestine divide.
Abu-Assad brings raw, human emotions into the situation, adding a poignancy to this engrossing piece of cinema.
Hard-hitting moments abound amid the slightly tangled plotting.
The same story could have been set in any period, but set in an urgent contemporary world this is alive to the major moral conundrums contained in the everyday.
A masterful filmmaker, Abu-Assad choreographs heart-pounding Bourne-esque chase scenes ... while deftly marking the passage of time.
