Music here seems to have a miraculous power to lift up, to awaken, to reinvigorate.
Equal parts heart-wrenching and heart-lifting ...
The movie is at its best when documenting the reactions of various patients, which in some cases is nearly miraculous.
Alive Inside is a small but vibrant miracle. The documentary finds hope and joy in one of our nation's bleakest settings, nursing homes.
In a world drowning in bad news about dementia - an estimated 5 million Americans currently suffer, 10 million serve as their caregivers, with both numbers inevitably going up - "Alive Inside" is positively tonic.
(Director Michael) Rossato-Bennett and (subject Dan) Cohen struck me at times as being perhaps a little too self-congratulatory, yet the significance of this beautifully-composed documentary and the breakthroughs it depicts can't be denied.
"We are made to age," filmmaker Michael Rossato-Bennett says about halfway through "Alive Inside," which may be the most radical statement you'll hear in a movie theater all year.
The iPods of Youth
"Alive Inside" contains a tiny revolution within its message, and will likely end up being one of the most important documentaries of the year.
Whle it an be faulted for its shortcomings as a film and even as an argument, it's welcome for providing a glimpse of what amounts to an alternative treatment for the ever-growing number of Americans suffering from dementia.
Gratifying documentary.
Delivers significant emotion with a uneasy topic, finding a rich sense of hope in the seemingly hopeless inevitability of aging.
I would have preferred a documentary that did more presenting and less pushing. But...the music's vivifying effect on old souls made for some of the most moving scenes I've seen all year.
Uncovers the power of music to heal mentally and emotionally, while the drug corporations and nursing home industry oppose these efforts. Neither of which is in the business of curing patients, but rather perpetuating profits by treating symptoms instead.
