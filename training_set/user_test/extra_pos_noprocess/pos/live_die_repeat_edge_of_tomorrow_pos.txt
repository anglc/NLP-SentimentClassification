The conceit may sound constricting, but Liman (like Harold Ramis before him) gets exceptional mileage out of it, presenting his ever-revolving tale with visual style, narrative velocity, and a wonderful dose of dark humor.
This is a movie about Tom Cruise working very, very hard to please the world.
Ultimately, this is a two-hour video game. But the filmmakers play it well.
Cruise is better than he's been in a while because he damps down his usual all-intensity-all-the-time MO. He's best here when his character seems the most scared.
All in all, a perfectly superior example of industrially fortified Hollywood fun, and as good a guarantee as Doug Liman can offer that we haven't seen the last of him yet.
A bold concept which could have easily resulted in tedium, but not in Liman's hands
Cruise is a winner all the way, whether he's being a gung-ho hero or the butt of the joke.
With its intriguing premise, engaging characters, and plenty of thrills to go around, Edge of Tomorrow makes for a breath of fresh air in a genre that has been crushed under monotony as of late.
A deftly calibrated sci-fi spectacle.
More story than testosterone, more time-jump-cuts than spacey filler, and more war-as-hell than war-as-cool. Leaves you pondering if we're 'masters of our fate' or just action-figures going through the emotions in some supreme player's idea of a war game.
It's an exceptionally entertaining, consistently humorous, and surprisingly moving story sporting top-notch visual effects...
Tom Cruise once again shows why he's still a movie star in this exciting, inventive and witty sci-fi actioner.
Cruise and Blunt take you on a (literally) loopy ride that's entertaining and doesn't wear out its welcome.
Clever and fast-paced with a welcome streak of dark humor, this sci-fi actioner is undeniably entertaining, if ultimately not terribly substantial.
It succeeds on modest terms, yet it's certainly not worth repeating over and over.
Doug Liman directed, making the most of every opportunity for a quick cut, a good laugh and a new surge of adrenaline.
This is not a run-of-the-mill genre yarn in the vein of countless modern sci-fi blockbusters, but a fascinating and enjoyable vehicle that creates an ambitious illusion.
Edge of Tomorrow is an ingenious action-comedy about how frequently movie heroes would actually die if they attempted that much crazy s***.
There is a good bit of humor in the movie and the performances of Cruise and Blunt are spot on, with good supporting work from Bill Paxton, who plays a very hard-headed sergeant.
Keeps the pace and dialogue snappy enough for a classic screwball comedy, at least until the inevitable overkill of the boom-bastic finale, centered on an alien-infested Louvre.
One of the best, most intelligent, most exciting and surprisingly funny special effects-laden epics I have seen in several summers. A model of cinematic craftsmanship from page to screen.
The financial failure of EDGE OF TOMORROW represents the greatest inverse relationship between quality and ticket sales since TWILIGHT sent breathless teen girls storming into theatres.
Smart, unpredictable, expertly designed, shot and edited, well acted and boasting impressive special effects, "Edge of Tomorrow" is science fiction and the summer blockbuster done right.
...thrilling and unexpectedly comedic...
