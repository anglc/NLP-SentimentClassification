The film is an obvious labor of love for all concerned, and the good times are infectious.
The uninitiated may not go for the all-too-convenient crime solving, melodramatic love triangle, and playful banter, but cultists will find all the show's pleasures intact.
Veronica herself is such a breath of fresh air as a strong female character: smart, secure, resourceful, loyal, funny and not the slightest bit chickish.
This isn't just a nostalgia trip. Almost a decade has passed, and the characters aren't just older, they've changed in recognizable and gratifying ways.
Somehow, miraculously, the Veronica Mars movie is definitely not bad. It's pretty damn good, actually.
Right now, the question is how did Veronica Mars turn out as a movie? It's a mixed bag. Too much time wasted on a whodunit that's more like a who-cares. No matter. Mars fans will have a blast.
Despite its middle-class magnolia feel in one respect, it has some sharp lines, twists and turns, revived characters, a neat score and good jokes about Warner Bros' stalwart Clint Eastwood.
A return to the admired television series is equal parts fun and frustrating.
It's not much of a movie, but it's a mostly good time with old friends.
It's hard to say how "Veronica Mars" will play to the uninitiated, but it's everything a fan could want.
A film like this always raises the question of whether newcomers can enjoy it, as they are unarmed with an understanding of the characters' histories and all the references that are surely contained within the screenplay. In this case, the answer is yes.
The Veronica Mars movie is sure to delight the legions of fans of the show, while also acting as a satisfying mystery for those who are just meeting these characters for the first time.
Such an appealing heroine makes it easy for anyone, existing fan or not, to be entertained by this yarn.
Bell slips back into her Veronica character with ease, and while newbies to the franchise might wonder what the fuss was all about, the "Marshmallows" are happy.
I've never seen the show that spawned it, but it was still exactly what I was expecting. I am neither overwhelmed nor underwhelmed by it. I am whelmed.
Let's be honest, this movie is for the fans.
Veronica is still the spit fire and quick witted Amazon who lands on her feet in every situation no matter how awkward or dangerous.
The film even manages things neatly at the end: we get a mixture of closure and openness, in which things are rounded off, yet there's still the possibility of another adventure.
Until now, Veronica Mars has been that movie that got funded by that Internet site. Now, it's just a good mystery movie with snappy dialogue. That's an even nobler thing to be.
Veronica Mars is exactly the film that fans were pining for and offers the kind of confident, small-scale storytelling that is eminently watchable to those new to the 'marshmallow' army.
Sassy, snappy two-hour spin-off from the original cult favorite.
