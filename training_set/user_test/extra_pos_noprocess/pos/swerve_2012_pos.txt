A watchable genre exercise.
...a brilliant noir that would have felt right at home in '40s Hollywood.
A solid Aussie thriller that doesn't quite live up to its early promise.
The story twists and turns with popcorn-friendly propulsion, never letting things get too serious to invite narrative nit-picking, nor too silly to squander the suspense.
