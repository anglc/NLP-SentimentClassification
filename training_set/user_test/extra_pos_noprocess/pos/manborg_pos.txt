A loving, if one-note, recreation of a very particular kind of bygone cinematic experience.
Too bad the story sags, although the padding is a riot.
Manborg is massively cheap, outrageous, and features a lot of overacting but it's also incredibly amusing with ridiculous gore and animation. It's like an homage to your childhood that you can't help but love and hate at the same time.
An acid-washed cornucopia of action and laughs. Short, silly, and superbly crafted with next to no money, Manborg is a delight.
Manborg works first and foremost by being genuinely, legitimately funny.
The colour scheme is garish and nausea-inducing but somehow Manborg is endearingly lo-fi DIY entertainment and Kostanski should be applauded for what he's achieved on this minimal budget.
