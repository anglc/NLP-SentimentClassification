The film's bleakness is almost satirical. It's Brazil drained of the daydreams.
The Double invites second looks and close examination. As Simon finds when peering into mirrors, what we see is often unexpected.
The Double doesn't get very deep, but it does get interesting.
"The Double" is a striking piece of work, but it's nostalgic for a kind of paranoia that may no longer exist. There are different things to frighten us now.
Although Existentialism is out of fashion these days, I think a lot of people will be able to identify with Simon's plight in this film. It works as both absurdest comedy and as social commentary.
Bleak dark comedy about contemporary urban alienation.
Ayoade brilliantly pulls off his film's mix of queasy paranoia and off-kilter comedy.
Some of the world's quirks feel shoehorned in, but the script earns most of its dark and discomforting laughs.
It's all very determined and beautifully wrought.
This may seem strange to say, but Eisenberg has great chemistry with himself.
Its clever moments outweigh its contrived ones, twisting into an atmospheric package that's both subtle and haunting.
Talented director Richard Avoade (Submarine), cinematographer Erik Wilson and the art and set directors have created a riveting authoritarian world.
A cheeky take on Fyodor Dostoevsky's 1846 story of a milquetoast clerk who comes face to face with a cocky, manipulative jackass who looks just like him, The Double proves great ideas never go stale if they access universal truth.
The result is supremely creepy.
The entertaining Eisenberg-on-Eisenberg action makes The Double a grim delight, but it's Ayoade's work behind the camera that proves he's the one to watch.
This is a smart and sophisticated film to be sure, and its craft has much to applaud, but it's the way that the film is never burdened with an overabundance of dreariness or ennui that helps make it the success that it is.
This movie is visually stylized to within an inch of its life, but there's unity between its people and machinery.
It's a decent actors' exercise, but...
When The Double lets us marinate in its distinctive visual aesthetic, it's provocative, occasionally fascinating.
