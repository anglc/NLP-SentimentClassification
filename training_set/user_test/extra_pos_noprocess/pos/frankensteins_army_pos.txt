There's little more in the way of plot, but that's no problem. "Frankenstein's Army" is funny and original, with innovative costumes and set designs.
Narrative depth may be in short supply, but the energy, invention and humor are bracing. And let's face it: Sometimes cheese tastes good.
Designed by Raaphorst and brought to life by Rogier Samuels's effects studio, Unreal, the half-glimpsed creatures are magnificent and repellent.
Pic's monotone edges towards monotony by the end of the third act, but as no-budget calling-card features go, Frankenstein's Army remains a grisly cut above.
As a fright flick it more or less fails. But as an example of how to make genuinely creepy monsters in this new, CG heavy age, it's a masterwork.
a 'mad scientist' movie made with outsized love that no reasonable viewer will be able too leave unrequited, all stitched together with political satire that cynically paints Frankenstein's freakish army as the final solution to the madness of war.
This thinly-premised WW2-set found footage flick just about succeeds by way of its excellent creature designs and unexpectedly clever political gags.
It's a bravura if deeply silly demonstration of what clever moviemakers can do on meager resources.
While our story leaves much to be desired, the fantastical creature work in Frankenstein's Army is too creatively ingenious to ignore, making these steampunk undead monstrosities worth the watch alone.
A WWII found footage horror movie? Yep. And it's good? Yep!
You've seen found footage horror and Nazi zombies before, but Frankenstein's Army mashes them together in a way that breathes new life into tired genre conventions.
Where Frankenstein's Army really shines is with the stunning designs and monster make-up, with the film delivering old-style lumbering monsters without resorting to CGI.
