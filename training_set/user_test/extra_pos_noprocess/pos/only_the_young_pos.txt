An elegant capture of the most elusive story of all: the awkward but nevertheless intense friendship between boys.
If you think one summer in the lives of three skate punks in a sunny Southern California Podunk wouldn't make a fresh, engaging documentary, "Only the Young" is here to prove you wrong.
The helmers find consistently invigorating camera angles and a smooth editing scheme, despite what was surely a raft of footage.
Directors Elizabeth Mims and Jason Tippet let their subjects meander, and instead unify their movie through tight control of tone, winding up with an elegiac portrait of teen America.
In a slim 72 minutes, it heart-tethers us to these teenagers, paying tribute to their unique and private selves while allowing the audience to see its own reflection in them.
Only the Young is an original and handsome work that belies the age of the two young filmmakers behind it.
Swollen with sensitivity and sentiment -- a delicate coming-of-age snapshot which locates the unextinguished youth in all of us.
Captures the essence of modern teenage life with warmth, honesty, humor and compassion. It's equally endearing, relatable and entertaining.
Tippet and Mims's achievement is to reveal that culture, subtly, achingly, by allowing those who grew up under its influence to live and narrate their lives in the only terms they know.
