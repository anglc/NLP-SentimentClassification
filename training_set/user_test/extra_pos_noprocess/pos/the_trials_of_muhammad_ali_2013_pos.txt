As with the best stories, "The Trials of Muhammad Ali" puts one man's story within a greater context. This is Ali's story, but it's America's story, too. Here, it's well told.
Conventional yet fascinating.
Ali's life has been recounted so many times that you'd think no one could come up with a fresh angle on it; documentary maker Bill Siegel succeeds, primarily by delving into the religious story, largely downplayed by the mainstream.
If you have fond memories of David Susskind's talk shows from the golden age of 1960s television, prepare to have them blasted away by this revealing documentary.
There is history as it's remembered, and then there's history as it happened. This documentary gives us the latter, and it's a true education.
It's a deep dive into one of recent history's most fascinating notables.
It's hard to go wrong with footage of the charismatic and abrasive Ali who is not always depicted as a saint
Works better as a history of events than a biographical film about Ali.
A rock-solid portrait of Ali's passions about faith and conscience, and a stirring case that his political legacy is more important, and will be more lasting, than his days in the boxing ring.
Where it finds strength is in its exploration of Ali as a man and as a symbol.
The Trials of Muhammad Ali allows us a chance to see Muhammad Ali not as an icon but as a man willing to take a stand, even an unpopular one, for something that he believed in.
With athletes in 2013 giving in to everything around them, Ali's strength feels even more palpable. He truly was the greatest.
As usual the most compelling voice is Ali's own.
Subject is Fascinating
It's a captivating story and a sturdy, informative documentary, managing to find a fresh perspective of experience for one of the most famous men in the world.
The emergent image is of a man who valued his convictions above all else, as tenacious and bold in his personal life as he was in the ring.
