It requires a leap of faith, but this handsome-looking film offers a disarming combination of insight, compassion and provocation.
Directed by Atiq Rahimi and based on his novel, "The Patience Stone" speaks for all oppressed women, for all oppressed people for that matter.
With a piercing edge, "The Patience Stone" is a cry from behind the veil, where a suffocating woman weaves a new life of her own design.
The bare room where the husband lies helpless becomes a confessional where Farahani pours out the woman's life story in a performance that grabs you with its quiet yet searing power.
A startling fantasy of Muslim feminist empowerment that allows the Iranian-born actress Golshifteh Farahani to put on what amounts to a one-woman show.
Some movies prove both immediately transformative - altering how we view the world as soon as we leave the theater - and long-lasting, demanding days or weeks of reflection.
A beautiful and haunting Afghan film about love, devotion, and a woman's 'duty'; a remarkable feminist story from the unlikeliest place on the planet.
As it progresses the woman's story is paralleled with several religious myths and it builds to a conclusion that is terrifying, far-fetched and powerfully-realised. The final moments resonate with a mythic quality.
It's Rahimi's courage as both writer and director that makes this intense and perceptive picture so unflinchingly compelling.
A real one-off.
By turns mysterious, moving, shocking and explicit - and very different from the kind of opaque and quietist cinema we might expect.
A beguiling and perplexing piece of conceptual slow cinema from Iranian director Atiq Rahimi.
Another absorbing lead performance from Golshifteh Farahani in Atiq Rahimi's The Patience Stone
In a war-raved city, a woman sits and talks to her husband. He doesn't say much, since he's been shot and he's in a coma.
