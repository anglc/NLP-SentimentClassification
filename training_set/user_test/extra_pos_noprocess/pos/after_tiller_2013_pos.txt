"After Tiller" does viewers the great service of providing light where there's usually only heat, giving a human face and heart to what previously might have been an abstract issue or quickly scanned news item.
What makes this well-edited film compelling are the stories of the patients and the agonizing moral quandaries that the doctors express in doing their work.
It's a calm, thoughtful film about an incendiary subject, and it has a clear point of view: to allow these doctors (and some of their patients, who we hear but don't see) to explain why they do what they do.
Any viewer with an interest in this issue, whether pro-life, pro-choice or agnostic, ought to see this heart-piercing report from the front lines.
This wrenching documentary, profiling the four doctors who still provide third-trimester abortions in the U.S., is remarkable for being so level-headed.
More than simply informative (which it most certainly is), After Tiller is a reminder that seeing eye-to-eye is rarely as impossible as we might think.
This documentary portrait of abortion doctors in America, particularly those who perform late-term abortions, looks at those who do important, compassionate work, but isn't as engaging as it should be.
The film goes about its grave task with compassion, basic professionalism, and discretion.
Directors Martha Shane and Lana Wilson in this topical documentary ably tackle in a fair-minded and detailed way the controversial issue of third-trimester abortions.
Rarely is this issue presented so fairly and without the requisite hysteria.
It's a grim story.
A laudably even-handed examination of a highly charged subject.
The story of four women and their attempts to uphold abortion rights in the US makes for compelling, if horrifying viewing.
We can see how they wrestle and it's immeasurably moving because they've given it endless consideration and still put themselves in harm's way.
Its strength lies in its ability to coax out the personalities behind the arguments, and to show us that, at the heart of every such controversy, there are vulnerable human beings.
This is one of the best films I've seen this year. The access to doctors, their staffs, patients and families is very impressive. It has a lot of emotional power and it plays the abortion issue right down the middle.
If After Tiller does not feel grim, despite the overwhelming presence in it of death and mourning, that's perhaps because it is so much a film about intimacy and trust.
Moving, thought-provoking documentary.
Wrenching portrait of life and death decisions where even the definition of "life" is emotionally laden for doctors and pregnant women considering abortion.
Simultaneously tough and compassionate, it's a fine addition to the debate.
