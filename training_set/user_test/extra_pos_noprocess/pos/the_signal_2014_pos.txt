There's something welcome about a motion picture that doesn't hand out a dumbed-down resolution in a neatly wrapped package.
There's bravura manipulativeness to The Signal, the stylish, slyly funny question mark of a movie from director and co-writer William Eubank.
The Signal is too ambitious for its own good, but it is still a pleasure to watch.
Much more elaborate than the typical example of 'Sundance science fiction'...
It is as if someone had decided to turn high-concept SF into a lyrical indie poem, where ideas and feelings trump noisy genre gestures - which makes the film stand out, quietly, from the crowd, even as it confronts the bounds of infinity.
Eubank makes up for occasional cinematic stasis with a convincingly mysterious viewing experience that successfully sustains interest all the way to the final frame.
Slyly stylish sci-fi - and strangely surreal.
THE SIGNAL is the second feature by former cameraman William Eubank, and it looks terrific. He clearly understands the concept of visual space and clarity, rather than the cluttered jumble of so many other sci-fi movies.
Captivating and engrossing...(but it) becomes too derivative by the end as well as a head-scratcher for viewers.
I found this film to be sufficiently intriguing... it poses enough of a mystique that you feel compelled to anticipate the outcome.
A fascinating head-scratcher, where the audience's bewilderment is equal parts clever scripting and random weirdness.
The Signal may come down to an ending that can't quite rise to meet the power, pleasure and performances of the film that precedes it, but as the striking and exciting work of a young talent worth making noise about, you can hear it loud and clear.
"The Signal" is a sci-work of thoughtful hints and feints, but the movie's big reveal raises as many questions as it answers.
In spite of vague 'Heroes' like plot and familiar twists, the film's visuals are a kick.
