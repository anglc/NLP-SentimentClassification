A good-looking and exceedingly polite film where perhaps a more complex one with less good manners would have been better.
It's an old-fashioned movie with a very modern streak, centered by a vibrant star turn by Mbatha-Raw, whose watchful, wise Dido makes an enchanting heroine.
Charming and stirring.
Luminous British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw brings a hope and intelligent hunger to Dido. She's loved by her family enough to have a sense of belonging but hemmed in by broader cultural realities to experience moments of unease.
The film simply looks lovely, never moreso than when Mbatha-Raw is on screen.
Belle presents an interesting history lesson, one that had significant repercussions, but some of the developments in this storyline turn out to be woefully convenient.
Though having the kind of pedestrian pace which often hits British costume dramas (Keira Knightley's 2008 film The Duchess excepted), Belle is sumptuously filmed and feels relevant.
The teenage Dido Elizabeth Belle is impressively played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw with a tender sensibility and a growing awareness.
The film works as both an intimate character piece and as a broader glimpse into socioeconomic conflicts regarding tolerance and perception.
A finely wrought tale of a woman out of time, a film that plays eloquently upon the heartstrings as it interweaves familiar personal intrigue with stirring social history.
Loosely inspired by the true story of a mixed-race woman who mingled with the aristocracy of 18th-century England, Belle is a frock flick with a difference... In this costume drama something is actually going on beneath the bonnet.
The direction from Amma Assante is perfectly judged and impeccably paced and the result is a film which is very easy on the eye but has a lot to say for itself.
This inextricable intertwining of love and justice, private and public, personal and political, is the film's great cri de coeur and its structural brilliance, as costume and courtroom drama comment on, and merge into, each other.
Wonderful true story about a mixed-race woman raised in an aristocratic British family in the late 18th century; like the best Jane Austen romance with an angry social conscience.
The plot feels like a Jane Austen novel infused with a hot-potato political issue, but this is actually a true story.
Asante's own work of art is lamentably cautious but does, ultimately, throw up things we haven't seen before. It's pretty, in other words, but not entirely vacant.
It's hard to imagine the true story of Britain's first mixed-race aristocrat being told more elegantly than in this warm and often very funny period piece, which brings a subtle political gravitas to its central fairy-tale romance.
With Belle, Asante has succeeded in making a sweeping costume drama that confronts questions of race and gender head on -- something that Merchant Ivory films rarely managed to do.
A spirited, good-natured and crowd-pleasing costume drama.
An assured rendering of a fascinating true story that gives off sparks of wit and vitality that make it instantly engrossing.
Asante handles this mainstream commercial picture with assurance.
One of the points of Belle, expressed in its central metaphor of the portrait for which the cousins pose, is that someone is always at risk of being painted out of history. The film paints everyone back in.
Race, love and social politics are deftly handled in Amma Asante's forcefully-acted feminist period drama.
Belle - while never slipping into fiery polemic - makes its political points solidly, careful to couch its righteous invective in a compelling narrative inspired by a true story.
