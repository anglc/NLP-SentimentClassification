Pleasant is the perfect word with which to describe The English Teacher, an ingratiating little comedy that aims to please and succeeds at its modest goal.
A screwball comedy that could have been screwier, "The English Teacher" is as interesting for its cast as its content.
Funny and fulfilling, Craig Zisk has created a small, triumphant feature film debut.
In short, The English Teacher is nothing fancy. It's a compromise made in the interest of good taste, and while that may not stand the test of time, it proves easy in the moment.
Nicely done package of high school hijinks with a few comedic surprises.
Julianne Moore excels in this amusing comedy about a flawed heroine who loses all sense of perspective but deserves a happy ending anyway.
Moore shows physical-comedy chops that are both admirable and quite funny..a small but very funny treat with a cast to die for.
