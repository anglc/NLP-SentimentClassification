Jordan is no stranger to the yearnings of vampires. He directed Interview With the Vampire. But Byzantium is a kinder, gentler yet pretty durn bloody affair.
Go ahead, bite.
Byzantium has a few moves that might surprise you. They have nothing to do with blood, but everything to do with the heart.
Neil Jordan's sensitive and very slow exploration of vampire angst. That the film also seems intended as some kind of vampire feminist statement makes it a rare combination of mildly boring and mildly hilarious.
Byzantium is a refreshing take on the vampire genre.
Although audience fatigue regarding vampires has surely set in...this is a romantic, sensual, bloody good time of a movie for sophisticated adults.
As the feature jumps backwards and forwards in time, and stories within stories coalesce, a striking tapestry is woven illustrating a world where eternal beings struggle with great change. Jordan's vampiric universe is bloody, adult, and melancholy.
Clara becomes more the subject of Jordan's empathy than the object of his lust (although there's some of that, too).
It's stylish and gory, with excellent performances and a similarly grim approach to the life of a vampire. And it's not really a scary movie, although, whatever it is, it's a good one.
A gory Gothic thriller whose departures from traditional horror lore give the overworked vampire genre a rejuvenating transfusion of new blood.
Byzantium is a connoisseur's vampire film; a vintage red.
Jordan's customarily stylish and elegant direction carries the film, and he's aided by the leads' outstanding performances...
This extremely elegant fantasy has roots in a plausible situation: maybe vampires don't exist, but there has been a child or two raised by a wolf...how do such children get their experience into words, get past the shame? Who will believe them?
With a magnetic performance from Saoirse Ronan, a surprisingly excellent performance from Gemma Arterton, and a deliciously peculiar spin on familiar lore, Byzantium is a refreshing take on vampires.
Jordan, true to form, moves fluidly between past and present toward an archly frenetic finale.
Byzantium offers a twist or two on the traditional vampire mythology ... but otherwise [its] gothic atmosphere and air of tragedy feel awfully familiar.
