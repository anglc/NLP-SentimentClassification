Mr. Wechsler's film might be loose to a fault, but Mr. Weber's work yields its share of gratifying, blink-and-you'll-miss-it New York moments.

Well-balanced, witty and illuminating. A must-see for anyone who's even remotely interested in photography
The film's segments move seamlessly from one topic to the next with the unselfconscious ease of a good dinner party.
