It's not a perfect blend, but Ben Wheatley's film is different enough - on second thought, let's just call it what it is: weird - to warrant your attention. Your admiration, even.
A British black comedy made in the spirit of "let's run with this demented premise till the tank is empty."
It's just not quite funny enough.
With a wink and a shrug, Sightseers shows us evil in all its banality.
A brilliant, deliciously wicked, and thoroughly enjoyable road film ...
Darkly funny as it is, the movie has undercurrents of genuine and very British weirdness.
The film is certainly funny, but the laughs aren't as constant as you'd hope from a film like this.
Uncomfortably lurching from broad slapstick to dark and sharp gore - often in the space of a single scene - Sightseers adds up to a rather jumbled whole, despite the punchlines hitting as often as they miss.
Devised by acting-writing comedy team Lowe and Oram and co-scripted by Amy Jump, director Ben Wheatley's professional and personal partner, the movie pokes fun at the social limitations of these lumpen Midlanders without sneering at or patronizing them.
An undeniable treat for lovers of morbid comedy.
It's definitely not for everyone, but if you can stand the stink of the human condition, Sightseers will linger in the lobes of your imagination long enough to make you laugh.
Sightseers is a brilliantly grim and reasonably amusing comedy that is also wonderfully unpredictable and constantly pushing unforeseen circumstances.
pitch-black and funny, nearly as dismal as Kill List but played for laughs rather than horror.
Daft and darkly hilarious, but bleak? Oh yes. Almost too bleak.
It's usually difficult to find serial killers who are sympathetic and even charming, but this amusing dark comedy does just that without sacrificing its moral compass.
A quick, dry, acidic comedy that will appeal to anyone who likes horror movies or pitch-black humor.
Welcome to My Camp
One of the funniest, and bleakest, comedies of the season.
What starts out as a sunny, funny getaway soon turns hilariously dark, a fusion of tabloid sensationalism and social satire ... a royal hoot, the funniest British import since 'Shaun of the Dead.'
Bloody good camping trip tale
