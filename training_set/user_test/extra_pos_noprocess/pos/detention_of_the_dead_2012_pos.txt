Detention Of The Dead is a silly zom-com with plenty of funny high school stereotypes worth taking a bite out of, which our zombies do every chance they get.
The easiest and most honest line on Detention of the Dead is that it's better than it has any reasonable right or need to be, given its aims.
It hits way more than it misses, and there are some truly shining moments strewn throughout the flick to keep even the hungriest of gorehounds satisfied.
