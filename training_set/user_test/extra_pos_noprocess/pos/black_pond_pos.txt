The message of the film is that normal people can be abnormal at times. One wishes there were more abnormal British films such as this.
Langham's performance may not rehabilitate his career. Perhaps nothing could do that. But Black Pond is really good: haunting, melancholy and strange.
An assured debut with great performances and a wonderfully odd brand of British humour.
You get your money's worth of surreal quirk but also pleasingly awkward comedy in this plucky Britflick, the dark tale of a family who bury a complete stranger.
