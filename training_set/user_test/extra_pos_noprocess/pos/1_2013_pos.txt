A fleet and frenzied sci-fi tale with more on its mind than alien gate-crashers.
Director Dennis Iliadis doesn't overdwell on the existentialism of the concept; he lets emotional beats strobe against the WTF experience of the temporal doubles, peppering the action with distinct images and events to make the repetition stand out.
A seriously weird little movie...
A decent, uneven, well-made spin on a very standard horror story.
Part Project X, part existential sci-fi head-scratcher with echoes of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Dennis Iliadis' +1 is a unique and endlessly entertaining addition to the teen comedy genre
One of those movies whose only chance of enduring is based on the word of mouth of those who have seen it, "+1" is a freaky jaunt through time travel that is well worth taking.
+1 will have you seeing double, but as time passes at such a quick pace, you'll have a blast trying to figure out why.
It ambitiously parodies and mourns the implications of the one coherent message that mass media manages to convey to all of its consumers in all its endlessly proliferating, ever-shifting permutations.
