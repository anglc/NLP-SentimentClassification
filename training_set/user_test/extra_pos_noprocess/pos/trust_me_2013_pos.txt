There's a fine tradition of acerbic movies that skewer Hollywood: Think "Sunset Boulevard," "The Player" and "What Just Happened," to name a few. The dark-humored "Trust Me" is a worthy addition to the list.
As long as Gregg, as both actor and director, is anatomizing the Hollywood viper pit, Trust Me rings true.
"Trust Me" contains so much terrific writing, acting and observation that it becomes a bit easier to forgive writer-director-star Clark Gregg when his ambitions best him during the movie's convoluted last third.
It is a smart, funny, endearing, and entertaining glimpse into a part of Hollywood rarely depicted in film.
Trust Me is a great offering from Clark Gregg that really puts the man's skill - in writing, directing, and performing - on proud display.
A grim portrait of an agent for young actors who takes his best shot at success in the nasty and venal Hollywood film community.
A smart, sardonic, unpredictable morality play that gets the little things right.
A surprisingly tough little movie about the reality of child actors in Hollywood.
This is Clark Gregg's film and he brings the right blend of salesmanship, anger and flop-sweat desperation to the role.
If Trust Me is any indicator, Gregg is a talented budget director of surprisingly downbeat, tonally staid, wholly effective tragedies.
