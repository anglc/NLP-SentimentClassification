Unlike, say, similar globetrotting, image-led works like Koyaanisqatsi or Baraka, Kossakovsky's film is never preachy, allowing the visuals to percolate.
You emerge wondering what (and who) might lie beneath your own feet.
Lovely stuff.
Perhaps a documentary to be more admired than loved.
A living sculpture of sky, water, landscapes, and the tiny figures (humans and other animals) that inhabit them.
Vivan las Antipodas! is never dull, thanks to Kossakovsky's constant inventiveness, always offering fresh perspectives, either through the physical angle of shooting or through the interesting juxtaposition of life on either side of the planet.
'We are one' may have seemed like a twee message in the hands of a lesser artist, but Kossakovsky handles it with grace and intelligence.
Wonderfully mind blowing ... It will literally have you seeing things in a new way.
