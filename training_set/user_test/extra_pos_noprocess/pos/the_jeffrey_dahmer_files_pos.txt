Different - and chillingly effective.
Mesmerizing and haunting, "The Jeffrey Dahmer Files" is an inside-out serial killer movie, lacking in gore or cheap psychology and made in part for those who think they never want to see another serial killer movie.
Compellingly illuminates how the monsters among us leave more than corpses in their wake.
For hardcore Dahmer obsessives only.
Thompson does a commendable job of making his points without overstaying his welcome. Given a bigger budget and better resources, it would be very interesting to see his take on some other controversial cases.
This approach to a true-crime documentary departs significantly from the sensational, and is all the more moving because of it.
Thompson's intention is not to explain the nature of evil but show how it contaminates the rest of us.
Thompson's film is something really different, a film as polite and as unnerving as its subject, one that burrows down deep into your imagination and stays there.
Chilling and riveting, even if it feels as if there are many questions left unanswered.
