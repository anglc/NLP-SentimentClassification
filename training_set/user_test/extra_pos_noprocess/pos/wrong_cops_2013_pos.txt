Improves on its predecessor by being effectively plotless.
Doesn't have structure, but there are laughs, especially for viewers on the prowl for weird stuff from a helmer who's become quite skilled at concocting ludicrousness.

Some of these routines are hilarious, others forced, but they're all routines, not parts of a cohesive work.
