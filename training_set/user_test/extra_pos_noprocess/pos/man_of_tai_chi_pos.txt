The brutally efficient shooting style Reeves employs to film master choreographer Yuen Woo Ping's breathtaking fights is refreshingly grounded and old-school kinetic.
Reeves has clearly seen many Hong Kong films, and with the help of two veterans, Hollywood cinematographer Elliot Davis and HK editor Derek Hui, he's replicated one.
Don't get too hopeful for greatness, but the damned thing works.
The fights are spectacular - Tiger Chen doesn't need wires - the camera work is cool, the music sizzling.
Pro forma, sure, but briskly paced. For the most part, the fight scenes are grounded in physical potential, but there are shots and edits that have simple physical magic to them.
[Director Keanu Reeves] cuts too much, but he respects the fighters' abilities - and the viewers' desire to see them.
The big revelation of the protagonist feels rushed, but Man of Tai Chi mixes this perfect concoction of outlandish and awesome and is extremely entertaining if you can just enjoy it as a simple martial arts film.
Reeves distinguishes himself behind the camera. The fight scenes are exciting and plentiful, acting as a showcase for both Hu Chen's formidable talents and Yuen Wo-ping's inventive choreography.
Kudos to Reeves for breaking out of the acting box.
A busy but relatively routine martial arts actioner.
Thank you, Keanu Reeves. Thank you for making a martial arts action movie as your feature debut instead of some sickeningly heartfelt personal story that's been sitting in your bottom drawer since you were a cub scout.
The concoction works, despite -- or maybe because of -- its unjaded, fantastical familiarity.
An interesting hybrid, however derivative.
Flirts with originality, and settles for satisfying
Cinematographer Elliot Davis films the fight scenes with thrilling immediacy: lots of long takes, so you realize you are actually seeing these guys actually do this, as opposed to watching something pieced together later in the editing room.
