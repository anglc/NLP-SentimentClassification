"Big Sur" cracks the code of how to adapt Jack Kerouac for the screen.
Sometimes feels like a beautiful illustration, rather than an adaptation, of Kerouac's prose.
...works as a kind of tone poem, drenching the senses in beautifully sad imagery, as Kerouac's poetry and prose sound over images of the sparkling Pacific.
Big Sur rises and fades, shifts and moves, through movements and melodies, singing a beautifully sad song for an era and a man who lost his way.
Competent adaptation of Jack Kerouac's swan song. Those expecting a groovy good time should look elsewhere since this is a movie about a nervous breakdown.
It feels like we get closer to the real Kerouac here, the man behind the book, unable to escape its shadow.
Big Sur achieves one of the trickier challenges in cinema, dramatising the inner demons of a character awash in melancholy and addiction.
