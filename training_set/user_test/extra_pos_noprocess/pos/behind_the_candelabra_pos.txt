It's both a romp and uncomfortably real.
Witty, briskly paced and consistently entertaining.
Buffed to a typical HBO high gloss, Candelabra is a visual feast. It shines brightest in those moments where it captures the rhythms of a relationship in its first blush of affection and its seemingly inevitable collapse.
The stunning and quite intimate performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are award-worthy.
The story is told less as a cause-and-effect narrative than as a collection of incidents that add up to something with a crushing emotional weight.
This is one of the strangest and strongest TV movies in memory.
As deeply entertaining and creative as it is socially enlightening.
Douglas seems to be having fun playing such a flaming swishy character and hams it up.
Douglas made his name playing powerful, morally questionable men, and this is a clever addition to the canon.
Michael Douglas transforms himself into the Las Vegas entertainer with style and, most of all, believability. Liberace was larger-than-life to say the least, and it would be easy to go the SNL route with a character by painting him with broad strokes.
Soderbergh and LaGravenese go deep beneath this voyeuristic fascination with wealth, fame, and the secret lives of celebrities.
One of [Soderbergh's] strengths is in the way he subverts traditional narratives and finds interesting moments that other directors wouldn't think twice about.
Crammed with garish decor, wild costumes and some unapologetically affected central performances, the final chapter in the life of flamboyant pianist Liberace gets a feisty, full-bodied treatment here.
With a lovely musical score by Marvin Hamlisch and Douglas and Damon perfectly comfortable with, you know, the gay thing, this is less surprising in its depiction of Liberace as a rampant queen than its authorised view of him as a complete bastard.
Michael Douglas turns in a charming performance as Liberace.
Behind the Candelabra is a fascinating peek into the secret life of an icon; the sad (reportedly) last hurrah of a cinematic maverick and proof that Douglas and Damon are fabulous.
The production design is terrific, revelling not just in period detail but in all of Liberace's excesses, and, typically, Soderbergh's camera and use of music are never anything other than top notch.
Soderbergh's masterstroke is how well he takes the audience on the journey of initially finding Liberace's world absurd and comedic, to ultimately feeling empathy for him.
It's ultimately a story about the power imbalances in relationships, and the quietly devastating way that couples can build one another up, only to tear each other down.
Its raison d'etre is a terrifically spirited performance from Hollywood's most heterosexual of Lotharios, Michael Douglas, aided and abetted by Damon and Lowe.
The screenplay's ability to keep us engaged and involved that the opulence loses its lustre and the things that matter in life rise to the top
In the hands of a lesser filmmaker, this is a project that might have gone terribly wrong, but ranking high on the entertainment meter, it smacks of authenticity, has pizzazz, humour, poignancy and above all, heart
Fearless and fabulous
As fabulous as it should be and not a jot more or less.
Excellent performances by Douglas and Damon highlight this tale of love and need.
It's the best skewering and celebration of celebrity I've seen in some time. Televisual origins be damned: this is one of the year's best movies.
