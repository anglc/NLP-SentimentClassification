Much Ado About Nothing is a delightfully spirited romp, filled with visual splendor, strong performances and flashes of post-modern absurdity.
The movie swings along, with a grace denied to some of Whedon's grander projects ...
The magic holds. It holds from beginning to end.
A delightful mix of the modern and the Elizabethan, a sort of do-it-yourself re-imagination of a true comic classic.
This new adaptation of the Shakespearean play is very odd looking, like a modern film done on the cheap, in an ancient language, viewed on a 60-year-old television set.
The wine flows freely throughout the film, and likely, all through production too.
But it is the dark side of Much Ado-everything associated with the smearing of Hero's reputation and her lover Claudio's savage rejection of her-that emerges most forcefully here
More familiar than fresh, but no less amusing. Whedon uses Shakespeare to remind audiences that the problems that existed in the seventeenth century remain relevant and embedded in the human heart.
Joss Whedon's adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing is a highly-entertaining romp with an exceptional cast. Easily one of the best films of the year.
Has a wit and style you won't find in his kick-ass work for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly or The Avengers.
Framed in Whedon's lucid black and white it recalls the feisty romcoms of the Fifties, whilst scenes of subterfuge out on the streets at night employ the visual language of film noir.
The movie brings to life a high-toned summer dreamland ... that exists in a dimensional rift between the Renaissance, the era of My Man Godfrey and now.
Super-charged with giddy enthusiasm, Whedon's ensemble brings Shakespeare to life in a riot of boozy passion and slapstick giggles.
Whedon's legendary talent for dense dialogue and wrangling sprawling casts of strong characters into engaging stories has never been put to better use.
A delightful celebration of Shakespeare's rapier wit...
It's a boozy, lusty, all-night party interpretation of Shakespeare that ultimately casts frivolity aside for a disarmingly moving finale.
A sublimely jolly presentation of a delightful play.
Delivers ye old fashioned entertainment with a slick makeover
A self-contained, astutely executed project, with Whedon's old guard giving their all for the sheer joy of performance. Great fun.
The film's biggest problem is that its Beatrice, played with spunk and spark by Amy Acker, is far more engaging and enchanting than its Benedick.
