Like the southbound train of the title, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's romantic action-comedy-musical Chennai Express barrels forward with barely a stop to rest.
It's just enough of a change of pace for Rohit Shetty to seem like a radical step forward without being so much of one as to be unrecognizable, as it's still funny and exciting, and the visuals pop.

Jump aboard the Chennai Express for a full-on, SRK-fueled joyride.
