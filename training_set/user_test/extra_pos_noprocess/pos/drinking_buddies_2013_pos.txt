The film's quartet of post-slackers are captured as they feel their way around the edges of what they want (and are afraid to ask for) with painful accuracy.
Here's a toast to the cast and crew: "Drinking Buddies" is a three-dimensional movie that doesn't require beer goggles.
[Swanberg] points the movie in directions that defy our expectations, exploring the characters' immaturity and the entropy of human interaction.
Not much happens in Drinking Buddies, which, frankly, is refreshing.
"Drinking Buddies" sneaks up on you; you think it's going in one direction, and suddenly it goes somewhere much more interesting.
Swanberg doesn't exactly reinvent the romantic-comedy formula, but he explores it in unexpected ways, with a terrific cast making the relationships all the more genuine and enjoyable.
I was a bit skeptical when I first learned about Drinking Buddies, because I did not expect Wilde and her cohorts to be up for the task; thankfully, I was proven wrong, and the actors go places that I would never expect studio-seasoned actors to go.
A beautifully observed dramedy about modern friendship and romance; funny, poignant, unforgettable.
It finds its groove with sincere, nuanced performances and a realistic attitude to romance as refreshing as a fistful of Citra hops.
For a film all about the betrayal of those we love the most, Drinking Buddies is a supremely optimistic, warm-hearted picture, with fine, freeing performances from its entire (albeit very small) cast.
As much a shining example of an improvised film that works as an example of one that doesn't, Drinking Buddies is nevertheless a solid romantic comedy.
It's warm, witty and wise.
A touching, truthful look at how friendships work when things go off road.
Funny, nuanced, relatable, touching, and an absolute pleasure to watch.
It's about what doesn't happen as much as what does. It's like real life, especially the beer part.
...won't change your world, but it's a nice movie to have a beer with.
The characters are likeable and engaging and the film ends up being amiable, if not quite winning.
The actors are so casual it doesn't look like they're performing.
The story meanders, purposefully, and doesn't lead to the places a similar studio film would go; Swanberg recognizes that disillusionmnet and disappointment are more frequent and universal occurences than heartbreak.
As an exploration of a specific point in life, this film is authentic and observant. But it has a tendency to preach at us, overdramatising issues rather than letting them play out organically.
If you're in the mood for a talky independent that doesn't look as if it's been made a by a wannabe Woody Allen, Drinking Buddies might just leave you feeling that your glass is more than half full.
Small and earthy, this low-key drama simply follows a group of 30-ish characters as they use their friends to sort out their own issues.
There are emotional razors amid the wooziness.
Swanberg is not so much kowtowing to romcom convention as putting great care into crafting something idiosyncratic, sneakily intelligent-and totally disposable.
Workshopped, improvised and mostly shot in small spaces, Swanberg's intimate drama is teased out with killer, subtle performances.
