Leslie Zemeckis' documentary about their curious and ultimately sad lives is a fascinating snapshot of the era of nickel-a-peek circus sideshows.
Likely to stay with you forever.
I found it immensely touching that these women found it in themselves to keep plugging away.
Both tragic and almost incomprehensibly strange.
Leslie Zemeckis examines the strange, tragic, roller-coaster existence of famed conjoined twins Violet and Daisy Hilton in the absorbing, well-crafted documentary "Bound by Flesh."
They were just people - which is why their story may not be that unique, and may even hide a few lessons for everyone.
Stranger than fiction and fascinating.
Zemeckis explores the tragic lives of the Hilton Sisters, conjoined twins paraded and exploited financially as so-called freaks in the heyday of carnival sideshows. Intimating as well twisted notions of fame, and the freak show roots of reality TV today.
If you've ever had any interest in early American entertainment, the world of freak shows, or in the Hilton Sisters in particular, this is exactly the film you need.
