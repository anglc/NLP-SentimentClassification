I really enjoyed how Director Christian James handled such a risky premise, and as a zombie entry, it's very entertaining.
When it comes to combining zombies and comedy, the British simply know what they're doing.
broad social satire, wryly banalised genre parody and literal toilet humour predominate as an unnamed handyman protagonist (played by the film's writer Dan Palmer) becomes trapped in the cubicle of a ladies' bathroom during a zombie apocalypse.
