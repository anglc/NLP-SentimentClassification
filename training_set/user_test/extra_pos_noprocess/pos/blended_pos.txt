It seems that miracles do happen in modern cinema. It's warm, funny, tender, serious and ( ... ) decidedly old fashioned. There's no swearing, no pandering to repeated toilet gags and the 'gross-out' market is all but ignored.
Even people who hate Adam Sandler - and there are still several hundred million of them around, the majority of whom appear to be movie critics - might at least take some comfort in his move away from gross-out films...to more family-friendly fare.
