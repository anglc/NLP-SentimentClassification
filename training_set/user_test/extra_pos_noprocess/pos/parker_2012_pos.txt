Overall, it gets by, but bets are hedged when single-minded efficiency and ice in the veins would have been enough.
A cool, violent, efficient adaptation of the taciturn anti-hero (the creation of Donald E. Westlake, writing as Richard Stark), who's out to restore order in a bloody world in his own bloody way.
Poster quote: "Parker," a film that's a little better than you'd expect!
Hollywood hasn't butchered Parker-which is to say that it has let him remain a butcher.
A little more energy behind the camera and a different leading lady and Parker could have been something great. As it stands it's a treat for Statham fans only.
As a tasty but un-nourishing rehash, it's not bad.
The action flick doesn't do much to wow you, but keeps things exciting.
Hackford brings a sense of style and sure-handedness to the proceedings that is uncommon for films of this genre.
Parker is well executed, ultimately entertaining and totally consumable but hardly groundbreaking as action thrillers go.
Statham puts the fun back into discriminate, pornographic violence.
The film has some bone-crunchingly good action sequences, one decent one-liner and it's all daftly watchable, but one suspects that this is more of a career high point for Statham than for Hackford.
Works well enough to prove [Statham] has more than physically demanding stunts in him.
Far better made than it has any right to be, this cheesy 70s-style thriller is given a thoroughly engaging kick by veteran filmmaker Hackford working outside his usual dramatic genre.
Slick, refined and so polished you can damn near make out your reflection on Statham's forehead.
