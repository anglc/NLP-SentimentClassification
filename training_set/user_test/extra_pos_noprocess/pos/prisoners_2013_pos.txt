In less talented hands, the story could lapse into the maudlin. But Villeneuve, director of the Oscar-nominated Incendies, seems to know just how far to go; only one moment feels less than authentic, but it would be a spoiler to mention it.
Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore.
Prisoners is unforgettably relentless in asking moviegoers if Keller has gone too far. And, by extension, asking us how far we would go.
Prisoners is in the best thriller traditions, but goes deeper into a reflection of one of the greatest moral dilemmas in modern society ... choosing to not only be memorable, but to matter.
Prisoners is a devastating ordeal through the Villeneuve's impressionistic prism. It's a testament to all involved that you want to revisit the ugliness of the story for the artistry of its construction.
The film not only holds the viewer's focus to the very end, but manages to do so in a genuinely innovative yet comfortingly recognizable way.
...wants to show how one heinous act creates not only victims, but more monsters.
Prisoners -- sometimes awkwardly, for the most part persuasively -- does a delicate balancing act between outright nightmare and naturalism.
Methodical, powerful and one of the year's best, this drama offers up a riveting script and a great cast.
It's engaging and gut-wrenching -- without diving into an abyss of emotional torture in the name of entertainment.
Denis Villeneuve made the Foreign Language Film Oscar nominee Incendies, but his American debut Prisoners just reheats the heavy-handed, high-gloss revenge porn of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and the aforementioned Mystic River.
Even the most seemingly benign scenes posses a low level of fear, and the final hour is heavy enough to leave audiences shaking (and shaken).
Nicely written and acted. Genuine suspense.
Like a more downbeat Zodiac, Prisoners is a rich, expansive procedural revolving around a horrible crime in which a satisfactory resolution only seems to get further away from its protagonists the more they obsess over the case.
...a bold, brave and unforgettable slice of filmmaking that pulls you deep into the mix and doesn't let go.
Unfolds with the sickening tension of a great police procedural, all while poking at America's social and political hypocrisies.
A dark, foreboding and riveting thriller, that will leave many spun by its labyrinth plot, spellbound by its strong performances and haunted by its many moral and religious complexities.
He's the film's most interesting character and it's a great performance from Jake Gyllenhaal.
...palpably ominous and unsettling...
If there is one thing above all else to recommend Prisoners, it's the way it captures that white-hot skewer of fear that must run through the heart and mind of every parent who has ever suddenly looked around them and thought, "where's my kid?"
Prisoners is haunting and will stick with you ... this is one of the best films of the year.
This moody police procedural with Jake Gyllenhaal in sublime form may be nearly three hours long, but it's worth every minute.
