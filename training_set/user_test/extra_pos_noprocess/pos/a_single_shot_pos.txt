"A Single Shot" is a singular pleasure, and worth seeking out.
Sam Rockwell is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors and he shows why that's the case again in A Single Shot, a rural, neo-noir thriller that slowly pulls the viewer under its veil of mystery.
Lands somewhere between a good novel and a deadly country song, all with the power to take hold and refuse to leave you be.
A Single Shot assembles an outstanding, mostly under-appreciated, cast and with them crafts a tense, disquieting gothic fable led by the always preeminent Sam Rockwell.
When the plot kicks in, and people actually start talking to each other, the film loses most of its momentum, but it still has enough sections of terse, pointed physicality that the overriding sensation of brute, blunt force rarely lets up.
It's Rockwell - and Rockwell alone - who makes "A Single Shot" count.
It's a small story, but it's tied into the part of America that's been affected by larger financial instability, the corruption of drugs, and the lack of education and opportunity.
I'd go as far as to rank A Single Shot among Sam Rockwell's Top 10 performances.
