Another sappy but engaging musical fable from the Irish writer and director John Carney, who made "Once."
The wholesome, hopeful, let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm may sound hokey but it's actually infectiously joyful. At the same time, Carney roughs up the edges just enough to make this fairy tale seem somewhat accessible and realistic.
Can a meaningful glance mean as much as a kiss? In this film, it can, and that's enough.
You can't really blame writer-director John Carney for trying, but despite a few very nice moments, this bigger, slicker follow-up mostly argues that Once should have been enough.
It's not nearly as good as "Once" but still very charming and entertaining.
Gretta's own songs aren't the type to grab you by the throat, but performed with soulful sweetness by Knightley they slowly sink their hooks into you, just like the film itself.
This movie is inspired by the success of the film 'Once', written and directed by John Carney. Carney's new movie has a similar story, but this time, with more money, better music and actors, he's made a better film.
John Carney's retread never gets close to replicating the stunning emotional core of Once. But for those seeing Begin Again from a fresh perspective, it's ( ... ) a more light-hearted ( ... ) alternative to the Coen Bros' Inside Llewyn Davis.
I've seen happier endings in Oklahoma! and Singin' in the Rain, but this one feels genuine - and in an unexpected way, deeply satisfying.
Knightley (supplying her own vocals, more than just competently so, by the way) and Ruffalo have a casual chemistry that works, and Levine is (perhaps unsurprisingly) totally right as a self-absorbed jerk.
I really enjoyed this. It's such a nice surprise, because so many so-called feel-good romantic comedies these days are pretty ordinary but there's something special about this because there's a level of reality to it in the performances in the situations.
There's a freshness to this film.
Bonds born out of art, and specifically music, are nothing new in the movies, but Carney conveys the uniquely exhilarating romance of the creative process behind art like no other filmmaker.
John Carney is not afraid of a cliche. After all, Begin Again is a musical, a genre that has always thrived on them. And he does know how to shape them to his own design, which is low-key and slightly tongue-in-cheek.
Carney's script suffers from more than a few contrivances, but the charm of the performances - both spoken and sung - shines through
Music is the driver of this utterly charming film about songs, lost stars and being alone in New York City
Thankfully Begin Again doesn't take the predictable routes; it seems to actively reject the easy romantic tropes.
People who love music, people who love great films, and people who love both, are sure to love 'Begin Again,' an exquisite film by John Carney, who wrought the equally superb 'Once.'
The film comes alive when the focus is on the music. There's a heartfelt authenticity to the production numbers.
A hugely satisfying ode to entrepreneurial creativity, and a glorious love letter to New York City and the art it inspires. I love this movie so much.
You'll find a mismatched pair to pull for and a lot of sincerity in this musical romance by the creator of Once.
In its best moments - which are not infrequent - is appealing mostly on the backs of watching interesting, capable people going on with their business in an engaged, focused manner.
This is the kind of film that lifts your spirits. If you've had a bad day or are generally feeling down, it will cheer you up. If you're already feeling happy, it will make you even happier.
