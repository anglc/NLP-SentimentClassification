Coming from anyone else, Ginger & Rosa would be a sensitive if predictable coming-of-age tale set in the mists of the distant past. But coming from writer-director Sally Potter, it's a major surprise.
A near-flawless film, beautifully shot and cut, excitingly performed and deeply felt.
Fanning is nearly perfect as Ginger navigates choppier waters than most teens have to. There is not a false note in her performance; no matter how melodramatic things become, everything about Ginger remains genuine.
Elle Fanning is scary. Scarily good.
In all respects, this is the completely captivating Fanning's picture.
Potter has a rich compositional eye, but she wisely trims the fat from the dialogue, which dances around most of the melodrama until an explosive last act.
Ginger and Rosa is a small flick that reminds audiences how exciting it is to see raw and sincere performances despite what kind of package they're delivered in
Fanning's illuminating, naturalistic performance...is the best reason to see the movie
Much of the night work,especially candlelit, puts "Ginger & Rosa" in the fashion of a memory piece rather than an objective history.But, as in all of Potter's work, it is an estimable and lush solution to the most minimal of budgets.
The complexity of the characters and the simplicity of the story balance out to a rewarding coming-of-age drama for adults.
With a rich sense of lived experience, Potter first portrays the blithe excitement and sense of joyful conspiracy shared by the two friends.
...probably Potter's most accessible movie to date, but the script is perhaps nothing special ...
Nuclear anxiety becomes a distraction from teenage pressures and a projection of potentially explosive emotional distress in this beautifully acted character drama.
Assured but bleak art-house girl's coming-of-age film that combines politics and personal matters.
Despite some narrative missteps, Ginger & Rosa should be seen simply for Fanning's exceptional performance, the sort of revelatory turn that makes us feel as if the next generation of film is in capable hands.
Fanning -- a startlingly alert and microemotive young actress -- breathes real feeling into the part, while the jazz soundtrack (John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Sidney Bechet) rouses this sensitive film from its drowsier inclinations.
Fanning heartbreakingly expresses hurt with seemingly with every fiber of her being. Her family implodes as much as the world seems about to during those 13 days in October.
Fanning brings such a groundedness and authenticity to the film's central role that you stick with her every step of the way.
Even seemingly ordinary scenes of girlfriends bonding - ironing hair, wearing jeans in the bathtub to shrink them, hitchhiking - are fraught with the sense of the external forces that will divide them.
The great gift of Ginger & Rosa is Potter's willingness to let her camera observe these gifted young actresses without judgment, and to create the illusion of ordinary life unfolding before your eyes.
