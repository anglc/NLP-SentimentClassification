In its simplest moments ... "Reincarnated" presents an honesty that is its own reward. It shows us an old Dogg with no tricks.
The rap artist's spiritual journey (he's now Snoop Lion) seems earned, rather than the publicity stunt others might have caught a whiff of originally.
The film is most convincing as a musical travelogue, drifting through clouds of weed smoke toward some form of Doggy-Lion enlightenment. If not taken too seriously, it's kind of a blast.
The film strikes an impressive balance between serious concerns and several hilarious episodes - usually involving Snoop and his entourage enthusiastically partaking of Jamaica's bountiful crops of marijuana.
There's a nagging sense of indulgence that leaves us wondering just how truthful this documentary actually is as it follows Snoop Dogg on a voyage of personal discovery.
Thoroughly engaging and entertaining to watch, thanks to a strong direction and Snoop's unapologetic and vibrant personality.
You don't even need to be high to enjoy this gratifyingly candid, funny and moving portrait of the Grand Master Toker.
With a legacy forever haunted by Death Row, Snoop is looking to reggae for something positive to leave behind. That's a worthwhile journey, even if it looks like it's sponsored by Adidas.
