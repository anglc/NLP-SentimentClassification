A lovingly shot valentine to work and body and art, and a generous, ultimately happy little story of a lost boy finding a community and a kindred soul.
Five Dances should well impress dance aficionados even if its skimpy narrative proves less than inspired.
Rather than adapting the pieces to conform to his paper-thin narrative, Brown explores the tensions and contortions of dancers expressing fresh emotion through a pre-existing art form.
Just when the plotting had me sighing with impatience, Brown would get back into showing us rehearsal and things would liven up again. It's in the recording of dance that this movie comes alive.
It's the moments when the director stops worrying about clarifying plot and character motivation and lets the performances bring those into being that makes this an authentic project.
