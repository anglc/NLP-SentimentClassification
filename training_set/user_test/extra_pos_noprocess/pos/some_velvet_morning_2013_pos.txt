With Some Velvet Morning, LaBute returns to the provocative style that made his name.
Though LaBute wrote this for the screen, I mistakenly decided that it must have originated onstage... because the oblique, heavily freighted dialogue seems too elegant and artful for a medium dominated by hacks.
This smallest of films marks a welcome return to the world of interpersonal miniature for the writer-director. I hope he stays here a while.
Well worth watching and arguing over.
It's a tantalising walk on the dark side and LaBute is the ultimate manipulator: I was enthralled, repulsed and intrigued, often feeling like a voyeur peering into a labyrinth of intimacies
