Worth a watch despite occasional laugh-free stretches ...
At its best, McKay and Ferrell's brand of homegrown American Dada can make you collapse laughing in your seat and cry uncle.
Wine connoisseurs would call this a new Burgundy with an old bouquet.
This is the kind of movie where most people know what they want and are pretty sure what they will get, that being "more of the same, please."
A worthy followup to the first film
I can't imagine fans will come away disappointed with the amount of laughs to be had here. Stay unclassy, Ron Burgundy.
It goes on a bit longer than it probably needs to, but the humor hits more than it misses, resulting in only a few sluggish places in a film that otherwise pays its audience's desire to revel in nonstop absurdity with just a dash of genuine social satire
Anchorman 2-2 extracts, objectively, 20 percent more of a viewer's lifespan than its fleeter ancestor did, and certainly it does not feel, subjectively, like 20 percent richer an experience.
Brevity is a friend to McKay, but as experimentations go, reworking known elements to manufacture a new perspective on all the monkey business, and the "Super-Sized R-Rated Version" remains a mirthful and mischievous vision.
Burgundy's earnest manly stupidity is a sure-fire laugh-getter and while he's off on his own a lot more this time around, his news team remains convincing both as his buddies and as different varieties of total idiots.
Fittingly, it all climaxes with a cacophonous, cameo-filled brawl between anchor teams from increasingly esoteric cable-TV territories.
I laughed more than a few times, but for every joke that hits, there's at least one that misses.
The movie works the borderland that connects the satirical and the surreal; the humor is scattershot but sometimes laugh-out-loud hilarious.
I'm actually surprised that a major film studio (Paramount) would thumb their nose so openly at the competition (Fox). Good on them. They've got balls.
'Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues' is even cleverer and more outrageous than its predecessor.
McKay and Ferrell keep the jokes naughty not dirty and flying for shrapnel accuracy; many miss, but when one hits it counts.
...has just enough curlicues of silliness.
All of the returning actors are funny and strong, with Rudd's Brian Fantana a standout. New guest stars, including Kristen Wiig, James Marsden and Harrison Ford shine just as bright as the story's regular cast members.
A velvet suit, trim moustached, salon quality haired, barely solid sequel to a comedy classic.
