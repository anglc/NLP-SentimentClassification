The movie, which MacFarlane directed and cowrote with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, is clever about its anachronisms. You stay surprised.
If you measure a comedy by how many times you laughed, Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West, at least for me, is a middling success.
Although hardly 'Blazing Saddles,' the movie is pretty funny when it depicts the Old West as a place of such 'general depressing awfulness' it can sink a person into 'a disgusting, awful, dirty cesspool of despair.'
Seth MacFarlane is tedious, but Charlize Theron saves the day.
There's no depth to what you see on screen here: MacFarlane is simply doing what he does best; delivering cheap laughs as he continues to try and push the boundaries.
Uneven yes, funny at times, yes, often uproariously so.
Theron's endearing rapport with MacFarlane the actor helps smooth over whenever MacFarlane the writer/director goes a little overboard with his penchant for toilet humor.
Humour is, of course deeply personal, some people will enjoy this more, but few would disagree that McFarlane is capable of so much more.
Where's Gene Wilder when you need him? . . . What MacFarlane has achieved falls somewhere between Blazing Saddles and Blahs-ing Saddles.
