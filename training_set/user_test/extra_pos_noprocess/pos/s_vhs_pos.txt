There's only so much shakycam and shrieking a person can stomach in one go.
After a lackluster start, V/H/S/2 shifts into a higher gear -- and vastly improves over its 2012 predecessor.
V/H/S/ 2 is raw and rough-edged and rude. It is also, for the hardcore horror fan, a total blast.
V/H/S/2 is likely to be as popular with fans as its predecessor. It certainly earns that right.
Inconsistency aside, this franchise remains a shot in the arm for horror fans, and it would be great to see them continue to make it an annual tradition with new writers/directors sharing billing each time.
Terrifyingly terrific stuff.
Slicker than the original without the sudden lurches in quality, this second shaky-cam horror anthology still has a standout sequence by which all the others must be judged.
An amusing and crowd pleasing selection of found footage from a group of up and coming genre directors with one deeply disturbing stand out section from Gareth Evans and Timo Tjahjanto.
This is a showcase for ideas about new ways to approach the genre. In that regard, it is both entertaining and inventive.
There are some dull stretches here, but also some grisly instant hits: nasty, deplorable, vulgar and sometimes brilliant.
Someone please give Gareth Evans lots of money to make amazing, violent, creative horror films.
The final product is a lo-fi, handheld hellraiser with a varying success rate but with more ballsy gusto than most mainstream horrors.
Agreeable, but the tape's been slightly chewed since compilation #1.
The first film may have been better, and was certainly more original, but VHS is a patchy, outmoded format that can always accommodate second-generation materials.
