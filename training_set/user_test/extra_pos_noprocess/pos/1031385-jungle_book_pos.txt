The standout song goes to Harris, a rhythmic 'Bare Necessities' extolling the value of a simple life and credited to Terry Gilkyson.
It's also got great knockabout visual gags, mercifully little cutey-poo sentiment, and reasonable songs.
Disney's grandniece recently cast aspersions on the picture, but I don't share her pessimism.
[Blu-ray Review] Looking and sounding like a million bucks (or more) and full of exhaustive bonus content new and vintage, the Blu-ray release of "The Jungle Book" is a must-own for anyone who loves animation, the Walt Disney studio, or film in general.
Every one of the bunch is memorable, and each plays gracefully into the action of the film.
Disney had perhaps the clearest vision of any creative talent in Hollywood, and 'The Jungle Book' is the last project with which he was personally involved. Though he died before it hit theaters, he would have been proud of the final cut.
Jaunty animation meets jazzy songs in Disney classic.
By far the most contemporary in expression and attitude of any Disney animated feature to that time.
A witty animated feature from Disney based on the famous Rudyard Kipling stories.
It's a slight tale, of course, and incredibly short, but the characters and songs are pretty much perfect viewing time and again.
Ridiculously entertaining.
With an ensemble cast of memorable characters, catchy tunes and lots of zaniness, it's hard not to love the Kipling adaptation.
The literally last-minute stab at domestic foreplay is simply unbelievable, but Baloo's lip-licking post-mortem ("I still think he'd a made one swell bear") is what sticks.
Reflects a conservative, imperialist, 'don't mix the races/species' worldview. Yet it's also about friendship and truthfulness, and it's just plain fun.
The roughness around the edges of The Jungle Book are part of what makes it such a classic.
...the characters, music, and animation more than make up for any shortcomings, and the result is pleasant entertainment for everyone.
Whatever it lacks in heroic reach it more than makes up for in sociable personality and devastatingly expressive animation from the Disney masters, making it an underground classic that's impressively stood the test of time.
