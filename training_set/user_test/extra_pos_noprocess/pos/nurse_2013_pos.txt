Huerta towers over the film, an Olivia De Berardinis creation brought to life in a world that might have been conjured by the combined psyches of Brian de Palma and Bob Guccione.
Nurse 3D shouldn't work as well as it does, but Paz De La Huerta's enchanting insanity makes for some memorably debaucherous midnight movie moments.
As good-to-be-bad movies go, Nurse is about as good as it gets. Or bad. Or... wait I don't know. Look, Paz de la Huerta is naked, okay?!
An early frontrunner for Craziest Movie of 2014. This is an unapologetic exploitation flick, executed with tongue-in-cheek style. It's got blood, boobs, and butts galore, plus a lot of outrageously gimmicky uses of the third dimension.
No matter what Nurse 3D is or isn't, as an entertainment, it rocks.
"Nurse" is more curiosity than home run, but it is a safe bet that no one will ever be able to accuse it of being boring.
It's campy, over the top, and incredibly gory, and it's likely the kind of movie to warrant late night screenings...
I don't quite have the nerve to give it a full recommendation but I do have a certain affection for it and I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from seeing it for themselves if they were inclined to do so.
Moves really quick, offers a generous amount of shocks, and displays a slyly dark sense of humor.
It's truly sleazy, and it's ridiculous. It's the kind of bad movie that a certain type of discerning connoisseur longs to discover.
Someone (who deserves the Presidential Medal of Freedom, BTW) recognized that if they went all-in on trash they'd have a classic, grindhouse exploitation film that ably scratches an itch for degenerate movie goers.
...a visually enticing hour and a half that is willing to do just about anything to excite. High art it is not, but if you are looking for a good time you might want to give this NURSE a call.
