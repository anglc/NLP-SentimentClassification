This is a multilayered film that not only exposes a man's contradictions - a do-gooder narcissist; a thoughtful, delusional activist - but also speaks volumes about the fringes on both sides of the political spectrum.
This timely documentary passes the test as a work of balanced journalism about a man of fascinating contradictions.
Anyone interested in movement politics in the 21st century will get plenty to ponder in this well-made doumentary.
