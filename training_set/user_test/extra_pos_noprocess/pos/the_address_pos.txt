At 84 minutes, and narrated by seven of the students, the film is an often touching, sometimes dull, and always well-intentioned portrait of struggling kids and committed teachers.
[It] becomes an instructive and affecting film, although not a true Burns classic. Still, it's nice to him as a fly on the wall in a contemporary setting, with cameras capturing the here and now rather than recycling telling images from long times ago.
The movie feels too long, padded even, but its relaxed vibe and non-cloying tone are a tonic.
A current-day, Ken Burns PBS production every bit as moving as any of his nostalgic classics!
