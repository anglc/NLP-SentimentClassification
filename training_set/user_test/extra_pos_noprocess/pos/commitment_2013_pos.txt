In this expansive, even elegant movie, Myung-hoon turns from assassin to knight-errant in pursuit of a virtue he barely has time to understand. His rapid evolution is nothing short of moving.
Commitment may not be the next big K-cinema import, but it's a fine display of solid craftsmanship.
An entertaining, well-cast action thriller, but it grows increasingly mindless, pedestrian, contrived and convoluted.
Enjoyable, if slightly tepid teenage spy actioner and a must-see for fans of KPop star T.O.P of Big Bang, Commitment's mix of gunplay and hand-to-hand combat is harder and bloodier than one might reckon for the film's expected demographic
