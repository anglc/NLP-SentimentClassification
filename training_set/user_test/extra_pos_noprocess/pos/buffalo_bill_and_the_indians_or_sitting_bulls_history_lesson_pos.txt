It's a sometimes self-indulgent, confused, ambitious movie that is often very funny and always fascinating.
While not one of Altman's strongest films, this cynical tale merits a look as a meditation on American history, mythmaking, and showbusiness
Scabrous revues of myopic mythology
Altman and crew have done the necessary reorganizing and reediting on Buffalo Bill and have created a terrific movie out of the troubled dust of what was. The first time I saw the movie in New York, it was explicit, contrived, and needed a lot of help.
Newman's inspired performance is top-notch.
Minor Robert Altman
Altman at his perverse best.
Explores the interface between heroes, hypocrisy, and illusion....What kind of America has been passed on to us by historians?
