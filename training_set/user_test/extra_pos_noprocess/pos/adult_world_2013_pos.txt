Adult World does have some smart, funny and wincingly painful things to say about the desire to make art vs. the desire to be famous for it.
It's packed with independent-film cliches, yet director Scott Coffey manages to rise above them, thanks largely to the performances of Emma Roberts and John Cusack.
A smart, incisive comedy about a recent college grad's booby-trapped immersion into real life.
Coffey knows his movie's at its best when Cusack and Roberts collide, and repeatedly uses them to overcome the script's limitations, and almost to dig a pit of chaos beneath it.
Cusack is fabulously droll as the reluctant mentor, while Armando Riesco delivers a touchingly off-kilter performance as the drag queen who also provides the heroine with lessons in life.
Completely stealing the show and delivering my favorite supporting turn of the year so far is Armando Riesco.
Adult World goes all kinds of satisfying places and the lowercase niceties begin with knowing how to use Emma Roberts' eyes, and their bright, darting gaze, which can flick from irritation to consternation to fury just like one-two-three.
It is genuinely funny and surprisingly touching by the end, which is more than can be said for most of Hollywood's efforts of late.
A fittingly rough zoom on the transitional period between dreams and reality, seen through a girl who says she 'can't be a wunderkind past 22' and mostly means it.
[There's] so much vivid, irrepressible life shoving through the narrative's seams that its structural defects can be forgiven, or at least largely ignored.
Adult World earns an A for effort
The core of the film -- the relationship between Amy and Rat -- clicks in a very real, very entertaining way.
