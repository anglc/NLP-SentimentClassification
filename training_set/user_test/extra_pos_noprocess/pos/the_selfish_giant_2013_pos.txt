"The Selfish Giant" is a story of dependence, damage and desperation, told with grit and grimy frankness. It's also a portrait of friendship born of need and emptiness, on the road to nowhere.
Clio Barnard's The Selfish Giant isn't the Oscar Wilde children's story, but more an inspired take on it in the kitchen-sink style of a Ken Loach drama.
Ultimately, it's a sad, tough sit - but worth seeing for its gritty honesty and strong cast.
Much of the movie is hard to bear, yet it never drags, thanks to the momentum that Barnard finds in the fable, and, above all, to the energy that she unleashes in her young leads.
[A] wrenching story of working-poor desperation in northern England.
The Selfish Giant is a film of such power and beauty that there will be no escaping it -- so long as you go to see it in the first place.
Writer-director Clio Barnard directs with ferocious maturity, galvanising "scrap" pieces of everyday life into a wonderfully cinematic whole.
Barnard's film is charged with the same compassion and lyricism. It is one of those desperately sad and dispiriting films that one would prefer to forget but probably never will.
There is a plot (adapted from Oscar Wilde's famous short story of the same name), and it's a good one, but ... most important are Arbor and Swifty, played to pure perfection by little Connor Chapman and big Shaun Thomas.
The Selfish Giant is one of the best films of the year: captivating, often funny, and filled with the most naturalistic performances you're likely to see.
Barnard's work with these two child actors is extraordinary, and she has written a lean script.
Anyone worried that the spirit of British social-realist director Ken Loach might not continue once he goes can take heart. Newbie director Clio Barnard has his style down pat as she tells of two teenage truants who scrounge for scrap metal.
A powerful, often gruelling but supremely tender fable about two boys scrounging for scrap in Britain's industrial wasteland.
Astonishing naturalistic performances, especially by the two young leads, gives this gritty film its emotional power, while the downbeat mood and provincial setting gives it a bleak tone
The story is movingly universal. You'll connect with these characters. You'll root for them as they risk everything to break free of the bleakness they were born into. And you'll feel it when, just as things begin to go well, they go haywire instead.
Writer/director Clio Barnard makes her feature debut with a fable spawned from an Oscar Wilde children's story but plays more like a pint sized "Of Mice and Men."
The first great fiction film to be released in 2014, Clio Barnard's second feature, "The Selfish Giant," is breathtakingly assured, ruggedly beautiful, moving and justifiably tragic.
There's nothing genteel - or veiled - about documentary-maker turned writer/director Clio Barnard's powerful portrait of austerity England.
It is especially notable for its compassion. It doesn't pass judgment on even its most thoughtless and conniving characters.
Somehow ferocious and coarse yet still delicate and often beautiful, The Selfish Giant relays a tragic tale with great power.
The tone of documentary accuracy makes the film even darker.
It's a powerful story about an underclass that might otherwise be all but invisible.
