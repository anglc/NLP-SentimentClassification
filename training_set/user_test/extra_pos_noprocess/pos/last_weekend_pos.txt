Clarkson embodies the longings, doubts and confusions of such a woman, without judgment or excess sympathy. She is just there, a fact, and completely believable.
This first feature from co-directors Tom Dolby and Tom Williams is too muted in its catharsis and too overcrowded with superfluous characters to be fully satisfying, but the delicate central performance keeps it watchable.
A sort of modern Chekhovian study of family tensions over a country weekend, this indie drama is very pretty to look at and at times disarming, but needed more punch.
Lovely. Features an award-worthy performance by the never-disappointing Patricia Clarkson that fully utilizes her sensitivity, comic timing and other distinctive acting gifts.
