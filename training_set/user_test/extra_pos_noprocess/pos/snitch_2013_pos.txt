Snitch runs close to two hours, and it's a credit to Summit Entertainment that they didn't reduce it to 90 minutes of Mexican drug loons trying to run John's truck off the highway.
In the end, this is a movie that lives or dies on Johnson's performance, and luckily, the actor is perfect ...
Despite its apparent compromises to noble finger-wagging (initially) and requisite fist-pumping (eventually), Waugh has fashioned a sturdy character-first entertainment out of Snitch.
Effectively illustrates the great heights we occasionally rise to for the ones we love.
Although hardly original, this tightly paced story will keep you invested through to the end
It's intense and involving from the start, even when it turns preachy.
Dwayne Johnson tries to flex his acting muscles in this smarter-than-usual action movie, based on a true story that gets under our skin.
Directed by stuntman Ric Roman Waugh, Snitch is also a surprisingly thoughtful affair.
Overall Snitch aims to entertain and yank a parental heartstring but events unfold, it lessens the effect and cultivates in a forehead-slapping ending that does raise the odd snigger.
Johnson has the acting chops for this more dramatic fare and the story is exciting and thought-provoking.
Consider it time well served.
Overall it's a solid thriller that hints at a life beyond blockbusters for its leading man.
