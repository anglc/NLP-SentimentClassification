This is Empire Strikes Back stuff. It has that second Star Wars movie's kick of confidence.
Director Francis Lawrence's film runs nearly two-and-a-half hours but it concludes so abruptly and tantalizingly, it leaves you wanting more.
The budget is nearly twice the original, and it shows. Great work from the A-list cast, amazing set designs and costumes.
Now the violence is not merely physical, but existential. Far from having won her freedom as promised, Katniss is now imprisoned in a false public narrative-supporter of the Capitol, lover of Peeta-from which she may never escape.
Catching Fire delivers on the grim, roiling promises of the original.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire takes the narrative and thematic liberties traditionally granted the middle chapter in a trilogy and drives the stakes up sharply.
Not only surpasses its original but also brings with it the undeniable sense that yes, finally, all the maddening chaos and underlying pathos of this deeply political story has finally revealed an important subtext.
Though overlong at 146 minutes, Catching Fire retains the original's curiously-engaging mix of The Running Man, Spartacus, Ben Hur, Avatar and Rambo.
Lawrence is the rare female action-movie lead who carries on the fierce tradition of Sigourney Weaver in the Alien franchise -- easily the best and most enduring "special effect" this movie juggernaut has to offer eager audiences.
The main thing that stayed with me on the trip home after seeing the film was the characters themselves, who are believably vulnerable, resourceful, devious and empathetic as the story demands.
There's no Disneyfication; Catching Fire has a distinct look and sustained dark, gritty mood.
It's an exciting watch and even slicker than the first film.
As long as fully formed products like Catching Fire keep coming, the odds will be in The Hunger Games' favor to continue being celebrated as the definitive popular moral tale of the early 2000s.
By far the film's greatest asset is Jennifer Lawrence, who again brings absolute emotional conviction to her haunted and conflicted heroine.
More (and better) Hunger Games
Lighter on action and futuristic visuals, Catching Fire is superior to the first film by virtue of notable performances and more compelling storyline. If the quality of the filmmaking continues into Mockingjay, I'll be thrilled to see how it ends.
It is heartening to find a teen-oriented movie franchise as gritty as The Hunger Games. Even so, Catching Fire remains contradictory, caught in some nether world between nightmarish political allegory and adolescent escapism.
Sharp as a flaming arrow and as explosive as when one hits a powderkeg, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the rousing, thought-provoking action epic the first movie failed to be.
The Games sequences, while familiar from the first film, push the story towards a thrilling cliffhanger climax.
The movie is a solid example of "the book on film" in spirit, and Lawrence is brilliant in a performance far beyond blockbuster-level acting.
The screenplay is terrific, with welcome shafts of wit.
Self-knowing, cynical, and urgently melodramatic, the Hunger Games and The Hunger Games indict you for watching it even as it asks you to buy in. And that is the genius of every iteration of the Games no one can ever win.
benefits from the impressive acting chops of Jennifer Lawrence, whose intensity and sense of self makes Katniss into a prototypical action heroine who embodies an ideal set of values but still stays psychologically and emotionally grounded.
