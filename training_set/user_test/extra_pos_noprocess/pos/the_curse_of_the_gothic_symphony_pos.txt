By all the accounts presented in Randall Wood's eminently fun, feisty portrait of artistic eccentricity, the formidable reputation of the mammoth, rarely performed Gothic Symphony by little-known British composer Havergal Brian is richly deserved.
Extremely similar in theme, structure and tone to last year's Mrs. Carey's Concert, it suffers in comparison to that exquisite film, but it certainly stands alone as a swift, entertaining look at a very particular artistic quest.
This gripping film takes us inside the belly of the creative beast - several bellies in fact, from that of the now dead composer, eccentric Englishman with the back to front name, Havergal Brian, through the entire cast of musicians and filmmakers
The elements of this documentary are revealed like a rising crescendo, as we become involved in the struggles, frustrations & triumphs of a dedicated group that attempts to stage the mammoth work - in Brisbane
