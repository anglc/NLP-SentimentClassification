Although more than a little meandering and self-indulgent, the film is likeable nonetheless due to its incisive characterizations and canny capturing of true-life moments.
While these loose ends might sound like scrambled bits out of an Eric Rohmer film, Mr. Maren's movie rather finds its groove in its humble domestic detail.
Not a lot happens, and yet, as in the best so-called "slice of life" stories, you feel one way of life ending and another struggling to be born. The little that happens is enough.
Modest but winsome.
Maren's script isn't deep, but it's heartfelt without being sticky, suggesting that the best way to deal with aging parents is to savor every tender frustration while you can.
The film flourishes when it moves away from a coming-of-age story to a more family ensemble piece.
A satisfying little film that keeps surprising you with its ability to tell recognizable truths in an original and human way.
