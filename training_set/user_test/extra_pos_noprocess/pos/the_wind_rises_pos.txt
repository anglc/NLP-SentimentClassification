The film is one of the most rapturously beautiful that Miyazaki has made, and all the more unsettling because of it.
At 73, Miyazaki's farewell is many things -- gorgeous, beckoning, compassionate. For better and worse, it soars above child's play.
When Jiro dreams, "Wind" soars; when he comes down to earth, the film can feel a bit stiff and murky. But then, that may be the point.
The Wind Rises has the sweep and majesty of a Technicolor Hollywood classic.
In terms of tone, visual beauty, and storytelling, The Wind Rises represents Miyazaki at the apex of his abilities.
Reveals itself to be not just a drama about love, romance, aircraft, or war, but a drama of the very essence of humanity: why do we try to live?
Fittingly, for a film that Miyazaki says will be his last, it's also something of a self-portrait in its depiction of a nearsighted, work-driven dreamer whose imagination soars above the rest.
It's Miyazaki's most atypical cartoon, yet it might be his most personal self-representation, a portrait of the artist as a myopic dreamer.
"(The) good news is that the film is a flawed but still very enjoyable flight of fancy."
A rich treat for the eye and soul alike.
If The Wind Rises is Miyazaki's final feature, it marks a suitably rich and strange exit for one of the giants of Japanese cinema.
A celebration of craft, graft and inspiration, The Wind Rises is a final masterpiece from an industry legend - and a ballsy statement that animated wonder needn't be confined to genre ghettos.
For what he has said will be his final film, animation maestro Hayao Miyazaki tackles a controversial biopic that could just as easily have been shot in live action.
The story has much in common with that of The First of the Few, Leslie Howard's 1942 stiff-upper-lip biopic of RK Mitchell, designer of the Supermarine Spitfire. But there is magic here.
It is a film with the elegant sweep of a David Lean epic as it unfolds in Japan between the wars.
There is a wonderful gentleness and intelligent idealism to this animation by 73-year-old Hayao Miyazaki ...
Ultimately, Miyazaki fails to hold the responsibility-shy Horikisho to account...and suggest he has his head hidden in the clouds as much as the young aerial inventor.
The desecration of beautiful dreams is a ghost always lurking.
Laced with poignancy and portent, Miyazaki's epic is an elegy for lost dreams - and a farewell befitting an animation master.
While Miyazaki's two-hour-long, historical-melodrama swansong is destined to be his most divisive film yet, it is also his most adult and interesting, and never less than visually breathtaking throughout.
Gorgeously evocative visuals, lots about Horikoshi's devoted wife, but a marked reluctance to engage too deeply with the deadly purpose of his beautiful aircraft.
The brilliant Wind Rises is another Miyazaki masterpiece - evidently his last. He couldn't have picked a more perfect way to sign off.
Few directors would dare to put the dilemmas inherent in military aircraft design to the fore, but Miyazaki's film deals sensitively with the notion that good work may be used for bad ends.
mature, romantic, grand storytelling
