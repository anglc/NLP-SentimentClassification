A glimpse of a surprisingly shy and gentle soul who longed to be a star.
It's hard to go wrong with a movie about famed drag queen Divine, and director Jeffrey Schwarz certainly doesn't in "I Am Divine," a serious documentary about this gloriously trashy trailblazer.
In "I Am Divine," bolstered by plentiful interviews with Waters and other collaborators, Schwarz effectively turns Milstead into the life of a party that didn't really end with his death in 1988.
Schwarz understands Divine, a heroine to outsiders, and Glenn, who took the persona as far as he could and was ready for new roles. His film's celebratory pizazz suits them both.
The Pink Flamingos star Divine gets her own well-deserved spotlight.
A fascinating larger-than-life portrait of its larger-than-life subject, I Am Divine is a beguiling blend of poignancy, humor and glorious excess.
It's surprisingly moving stuff - dressed up with just enough archival outrage to remind you how scandalous Divine once seemed.
The interviewees and even his mother, with whom he was reconciled late in his life, all portray him as a generous and very sweet-natured man.
This is, for the most part, a celebration of Divine's life unencumbered by guilt or oppression.
Schwarz interviews friends and fans, piecing together a picture of a gentle, perhaps surprisingly shy man who channelled his family's rejection and his anger at society into his outrageous alter-ego.
Despite the sadness, we are reminded of what an influential figure Divine was, and how his very presence continues to bring comfort to others who identify as outsiders.
A joyous hurrah for a unique figure.
Schwarz offsets the camp with a sincere appreciation of both the obvious, larger-than-life personality and this performer's oft-overlooked skills ...
Touching and funny. Waters fans should sign up now.
This is divine.
This documentary mostly looks back on its subject's career as a notorious drag act, with consistently amusing input from the likes of John Waters, Tab Hunter and psychedelic theatre troupe The Cockettes.
I Am Divine riffs entertainingly through the career of the drag star who blazed in Pink Flamingoes and Hairspray.
I Am Divine may not be the blowsy riot you'd expect given Divine's salty screen persona but it tells his story with wit, insight and compassion, revealing a rather sweet and sensitive man underneath that sparkling shell.
High camp and low trash make an entertaining combo in an overdue homage to a fearless trailblazer.
With an appropriate explosion of humour and colour, this documentary traces the life of a fiercely individualistic actor, digging beneath the surface to explore both his origins and his legacy.
A loving biographical portrait that encompasses the legendary icon's rise to infamy while touching on the emotional complexities of its subject.
Fans of Divine and of Waters' work will be delighted, and anyone else who catches it will want to dive right in to the diva's gigantic body of work.
Shwarz helps paint a picture of an extraordinary boy who lived so far outside what was considered "normal," he had no choice but to blaze his own trail.
A solid overview of this truly unique person's life.
The film's heart is the chequered relationship Milstead had with his mother, whose shifting regard for her larger-than-life son takes centre stage.
