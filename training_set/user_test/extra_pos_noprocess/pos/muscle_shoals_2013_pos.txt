Hall's backstory, riddled with tragedy, gets the proper attention and respect here. But it's the music that won't let you stop watching.
The movie is more a collection of cool people telling great stories than it is a structured documentary (despite Camalier's attempts in that direction). But in this case, that's enough.
Director Greg "Freddy" Camalier augments the talking heads with unusually evocative vistas ...
Occasionally baggy, always sincere, this is an essential document of a defining era when 'soul' really meant something.
Even casual music fans will enjoy behind-the-hits doc.
Greg Camalier's debut feature offers a worthy if sometimes ponderous take on a significant slice of U.S. popular music history.
Camalier's tuneful if somewhat overlong anecdotal history does the most justice to the Muscle Shoals sound just by listening to it.
Retrospective rockumentary deconstructs the secret of a legendary Alabama music studio's success.
It is amazing to see how this style and sound came to fruition as it changed the careers of artists like Aretha Franklin and created some of the most memorable albums and songs from artists like Etta James, The Rolling Stones, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and [more].
Camalier makes an excellent job of combining talking-head interviews with music, anecdotes and folklore.
An extraordinary story of singers, songwriters, musicians, producers and, most of all, two recording studios in a small Southern city.
A bit lengthy but packed with great music, this is a solid documentary that musicians and fans of soul music will likely enjoy.
Though Muscle Shoals can seem a little conventional, you could never say the same thing of its soundtrack
Supremely enjoyable, Muscle Shoals doesn't add much to the record, but it will probably induce you to flip through your collection for a few to spin.
Emotionally moving but messy, it survives thanks to its superb songs, great cinematography and insightful anecdotes - in spite of its lack of a satisfactory conclusion.
What is it that makes the music recorded in the studios in this small, out-of-the-way part of Alabama so magical? That's the question this documentary film tries to answer.
The movie never quite captures the magic of Muscle Shoals, but it's still fun to hear old pros like Aretha Franklin and Keith Richards trade tales.
Its story is well-worth telling.
It posits that the spirit of community forged by the musicians that created this music was part of its magic, and listening to it in the movie, it's hard to argue. The records they created defined an entire genre and hold up today as completely timeless.
The film possesses considerable persuasive power despite its modest substance and simple construction, making it very much like the timeless songs it showcases.
As Aretha might say, respect.
A galaxy of stars recall the magic of it all, although a little less boring Bono would have been a bonus.
And lo, the musical miscegenation was good.
The anecdotes work without the music, but if you like the music... Dang, it's a stairway to heaven.
Warm, enjoyable, smooth and lightweight, this celebratory documentary is a gentle tribute to a remarkable man and his work.
