There's nothing unlikable about the Plimpton we meet here, and his self-deprecation about his experiences feels endearing. It just leaves us wondering whether he also had some ambivalence of his own.
A hell of a lot of fun. George Plimpton would heartily approve.
Many of you will not have heard of him. (All the more reason to watch Tom Bean and Luke Poling's affectionate, at times intoxicating documentary.)
Well-researched and detailed documentary.
A delightful look at the public career and mostly private life of the ultimate professional amateur.
The film strongly evokes a certain segment of the American cultural scene from the 1950s through the '70s, though Plimpton continued working until his death in 2003.
As an editor, he launched impressive careers; as a dabbler, he illuminated them.
George Plimpton seemingly approached life as if it were a buffet table, and this compelling documentary manages to offer a sizable sampling.
Two new docs on American culture merit attention
The film offers a front-row seat to the marvelous, fifty-year-long piece of performance art that was Plimpton's public persona.
Yes, there are laughs, but Tom Bean and Luke Poling create a nuanced portrait of Plimpton, an upper-crust dabbler who was kicked out of boarding school only to make a life out of dabbling.
Once again George Plimpton is the life of the party.
