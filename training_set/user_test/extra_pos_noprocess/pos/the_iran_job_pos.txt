A lively, engaging documentary directed by the German filmmaker Till Schauder ...
I confess to being a sucker for sports movies, the ones with the "Big Game" at the end. "The Iran Job" has all the requisite elements of that cinematic subgenre, but strives for something deeper.
This observant documentary avoids pedagogy; it's not always artful, but it has a relaxed, light touch that never topples into pretension.
The sports drama gives The Iran Job a strong hook, while the cultural context enriches the movie's real story, which is less about Sheppard's life in Iran than about the people he meets.
This is a complicated, accessible and heartfelt human drama, one that Obama, Romney and Americans of all political stripes should see ...
A film that despite its modest means tells a stirring tale about sports and politics. Starring Kevin Sheppard, a completely winning personality and basketball player.
An honest and open portrait of work, friendships and relationships in a troubled and lively nation blessed with a vibrant culture and cursed with an oppressive religious regime.
If you invest in Kevin Sheppard's story, it will pay off.
This lively documentary breaks no new ground cinematically, yet its mix of discovery and befuddlement should bring more than sports fans to a basketball story.
As an entry into the Iranian world, Schauder and Nodjoumi made a wise choice with sports, but they made an even better choice with Sheppard.
The Iran Job locates an absorbing, cross-cultural universality with surprising ease.
"The Iran Job" has interesting characters, an insight into Iran's culture and the story of one lonely American who, for a year, was his country's cultural ambassador to Iran.
...an amusing cultural fish out of water look at how a big, likable, outgoing Black American basketball player fits into life in Shiraz in southwestern Iran. Then it becomes something more around the halfway mark...
