This documentary version of Jodorowsky's "Dune" is probably more entertaining than what Hollywood would have done to it, with a clearer message: Our lives are like sands though an hourglass, so dream the impossible dream.
A deeply moving testament to single-minded, indefatigable commitment of creative vision and to an almost spiritual ability to let that vision go, thereby allowing it to exist in the world in an entirely unexpected form.
Jodorowsky is a mesmerizing presence in director Frank Pavich's engrossing picture. He was 84 when much of it was shot.
Jodorowsky's Dune gives you a good sense of what might have been, and judging by what we see, the picture might have accomplished what the director ultimately intended: "To mutate young minds."
What an extraordinary dream it could have been.
It leaves you wondering about how many artists are working on such wild dreams these days, and hoping it's more than you think.
[The documentary] has, in Alejandro Jodorowsky himself, an amazing, one-of-a-kind storyteller, whose enthusiasm for the film he didn't get to make is electrifying and magnetic.
Buffs with a love for cinema's secret history must make tracks for this extraordinary documentary ASAP.
Easily one of the most enjoyable documentaries about doomed film productions since Lost in La Mancha...Far from changing the way sci-fi would be, Jodorowsky's Dune could well have been a disaster that could have killed the genre.
Failure has rarely been told with such entertaining dedication.
Jodorowsky's worthy of this film, all on his own, but his Dune is certainly a worthy recipient as well. We'll never see it, but we have this.
The year's must-see doco for movie buffs.
The phantom film is, by its nature, always rich with possibilities.
Jodorowsky's 'Dune' could probably have never been as good as 'Jodorowsky's Dune'-- a thoroughly entertaining and inspiring movie.
It's a fascinating glimpse into the creative process, told from the points of view of the people who worked so hard on the project 40 years ago.
a true triumph
Will make you wish Hollywood would have given Jodorowsky everything he needed (or that we could at least Kickstart the difference).
This is the ultimate cinephile 'what if' story...
No one knows exactly what kind of film Jodorowsky's version of Dune would have been like. But what's for certain is that Jodorowsky's Dune is in itself an entertaining, fascinating portrait into what could have been.
This film lives and breathes on the enthusiasm of its main character. Jodorowsky's passion for his craft is infectious and inspiring. Otherwise, it's a strictly routine affair.
Why did it leave me so oddly happy, this story of a beautiful dream that never came true? Perhaps because there's beauty in the dreaming itself.
Aside from Jodorowsky's Dune being spectacularly entertaining and intriguing, as well as flat-out surprising, it also contains wonderful themes, worth carrying into any aspect of life.
Coulda been a contender: the Dune that never was
A funny, fascinating rumination on art, ambition and the fickleness of fate. It's also unique in the history of film: a documentary that goes behind the scenes of a movie for which not a single scene was ever shot.
Frank Pavich's new documentary on the obsessive Chilean surrealist's projected epic masterwork is very nearly as marvelous as "Jodo"'s adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel might have been.
