A taut procedural with atmospheric location work that traces Cage's clock-racing efforts to find evidence against Cusack ...
As written and directed by Scott Walker, THE FROZEN GROUND isn't great, but it's surprisingly effective, thanks to its no-frills approach and its care with the actors and characters.
The Frozen Ground covers familiar territory but benefits from authentically seamy scene setting amid the bars and strip-joints where the killer found his prey, and from solid performances by its leads, all of whom are acting against type.
The Frozen Ground is trying its best to act as a genuine tribute to the victims of a horrible crime. Unfortunately it falls short... Though still functioning as a solid genre piece, the chasm between intention and execution is embarrassingly apparent.
The Frozen Ground isn't innovative, but it is a well-paced and engaging thriller that has the added appeal of a truth-based narrative.
In a rote cat-and-mouse cop-and-serial-killer story, Vanessa Hudgens' 'victim' is far more compelling than either cop Nicolas Cage or killer John Cusack.
A chilling thriller with first-rate performances by John Cusack, Nicolas Cage and Vanessa Hudgens.
"The Frozen Ground" trucks in cliche, as most serial killer and police procedural films do, but the strength of the acting (from the leads down to people with only one or two lines) helps ground the film.
Impressive debut from New Zealand-born Scott Walker is told with style and panache. Strong performances, fevered pacing and immersive location lensing are big pluses pushing this from "B" pic to A-.
We've seen a lot of serial killer movies but this intriguing true story is well-acted and involving enough to be worth a shot.
A true crime period piece that somewhat interestingly eschews a lot of investigatory grind in favor of moral certitude and throwback, cat-and-mouse tension.
Not bad at all. Nicolas Cage gives his best performance in years.
