"The Skeleton Twins" is a lovingly calibrated mix of heartbreak and hopefulness, guilt and the will to do better.
Johnson's unfussy direction serves as a fine showcase for the two SNL veterans to demonstrate how their comic shorthand plays equally well in a slightly darker register.
The Skeleton Twins is all the better for keeping us guessing as to its intentions, because that makes it more true to life. Sometimes you have to smile through the tears, and vice-versa.
If a movie with suicide as a central theme can be deemed funny, then writer/director Craig Johnson has pulled it off, mixing heartache and humor and giving Wiig, especially, the opportunity to shine.
In a poignant and potentially depressing film, it's redeeming to see that when they are with their kindred spirits, even the saddest skeletons can dance.
A wonderful and brutally engrossing dramedy about family and the lasting effects of growing up in dysfunctional households.
The Skeleton Twins makes for an engaging film that gets you emotionally involved, while also giving you some good laughs in the process, and for that intelligent mixture, it's a dramedy that's definitely worth seeing.
The Skeleton Twins is beautiful, infectious and painfully honest in a way that's normally reserved for someone that you shared a womb with.
An exploration of both the complications and the life-affirming dimensions of sibling relationships.
Heart-felt adult soap opera.
One of the stand-out indie productions of the year.
By turns, unbearably poignant and laugh-out loud funny, this reveals hidden depths to Hader and gives Wiig a golden opportunity to reveal the subtlety of her range with a knock-out performance.
Suicide is no laughing matter, but there are some wry smiles in this changeably moody indie-pic about self-destructive siblings.
The actors' skit-honed rapport is magical, not least when hilariously lip-synching Starship's cheesy 1980s power ballad 'Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now' in a rousing blast of sibling solidarity.
Both Wiig and Hader provide highly impressive dramatic performances, while Luke Wilson is consistently amusing as Maggie's relentlessly positive husband.
How can you not love something that gives Wiig so much scope?
A thoughtful and likeable drama with comic riffs ...
The laughs are here, but they are tempered by bruising regrets and simmering grudges in this elegant study of a sibling relationship in crisis.
[An] entertaining, bleak comedy-drama ...
Funny and sad and wise and wonderful... with an absolutely heartbreaking, career-changing performance by Bill Hader.
