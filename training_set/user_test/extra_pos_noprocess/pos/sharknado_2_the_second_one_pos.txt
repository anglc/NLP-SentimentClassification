Ridiculousness. Super-ridiculousness. Mega-ridiculousness. Meta-ridiculousness. Love. Fireworks.
Because they put the pedal to the metal and go full, screaming, bedazzled monkeypants crazy from beginning to end, it sort of works.
Kind of hilarious. Kind of silly. Mostly a game of spot-the-cameo players and teasing about what moment a certain chainsaw will come in contact with certain bodies.
Syfy's made-for-TV movie Sharknado 2: The Second One is just as bad as the original Sharknado, which means it's just as good. It's the perfect way to kill two hours with one's brain in sleep mode.
It's a stupid, stupid movie, but also, in its own way, rather smart. Director Anthony C. Ferrante knows exactly what he is doing, and the results are as exceedingly amusing as they are entirely inconsequential.
Simply put, it's one of those TV movies that's so unapologetically bad that it is, in its own unique way, also pretty great.
It was definitely the second one, the big, spared-most-expenses sequel to the internet's favorite movie. Did it have highlights? Sure. Did it have lowlights? I can't remember. Will there be more of these? Count on it, dude.
In a Rocky Horror sort of "so bad it's good" kind of way, Sharknado 2 is pretty fun in its silliness.
Sharknado 2: The Second One is bad, and that's good. Well, it's meant to be bad, in a good sort of way.
"Sharknado" was far from the most amateurish of the Syfy originals, but it had a "Let's put on a show" roughness. "Sharknado 2" at times threatens to look like a real movie.
(While)it will never survive under serious scrutiny, the fact that Sharknado 2: The Second One succeeds just proves that there's no stopping a satisfyingly stinky slice of cinematic cheese.
Sharknado 2 isn't aiming for that kind of subtlety, as the tone leans more toward thrills and action rather than tension and fear.
Sharknado 2: The Second One is the same as the first and that's all fans of the series should want and expect. It delivers bite!
