Although his first film is only a partial success, Yang Ik-june is a filmmaker worth watching for.
Breathless pummels viewers with nearly the same ferocity and frequency with which the characters assault each other.
Amid the violent outbursts are moments of warmth and tenderness, some featuring the protagonist's young nephew, the best hope for breaking the generational cycles of domestic tragedy.
Blending a thoughtful cycle-of-violence subplot with a piercing study of how even the most hateful and isolated people inevitably affect those around them, 'Breathless' is a challenging, dynamic experience.
We will give Yang, the film's writer, director, and star, the benefit of the doubt by assuming his chronicle of relentless cruelty is not autobiographical.
Although Yang's directorial debut is overlong and unecessarily laboured in the early section, he is genuinely bringing something fresh to the table in terms of the atmosphere he creates.
Impressive first effort by the writer/director/producer/star this downbeat drama is sincere and authentic.
One of the most relentlessly abusive movies you will ever see - the dialogue is a non-stop torrent of profanity, and the action consists of one brutal beating after another. Yet it cries out to be seen.
There's no denying its visceral punch, delivered convincingly with unsteady, hand-held camerawork and profanity-spewing dialogue that makes The Thick Of It sound like Yes Minister. It'll leave you breathless alright.
As brazen as you'd expect from a film with a name that recalls an arthouse tentpole, this debut from writer-director-star Yang Ik-Joon is tonally, one-of-a-kind odd-couple movie.
A film that works thanks to characters who aren't mere ciphers but come with deep, if hidden, emotions.
Gripping to watch, but make sure you are prepared.
Hard to watch, at times, but brimming with vitality.
Yang Ik-June, the film's star, writer, director and producer, slowly but surely lets glimmers of his humanity peep through. Expect imitations and remakes aplenty.
Despite its subject matter and harrowing scenes, Breathless is never depressing, partly because it is infused with the fervent energy of a deeply felt anger.
Cinema rarely comes more hard-hitting (in every sense) than this - and yet there is a real tenderness around its rough edges, as well as a disarming compassion for the sort of characters so easily dismissed as mere monsters.
