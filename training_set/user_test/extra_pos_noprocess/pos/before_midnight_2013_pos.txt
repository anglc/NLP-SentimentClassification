This is a universal X-ray of bourgeois love, one that in a few decades will get around to something like Amour.
Hawke and Delpy remain as charming as ever, and their combined goofiness is more endearing than annoying.
Love is messy here, life cannot be controlled, satisfaction is far from guaranteed. Romance is rocky at best. But romance still is.
Though "Before Midnight" is often uncomfortable to watch, it's never less than mesmerizing - and ultimately, a joy to walk with this prickly but fascinating couple again.
Before Midnight is fascinating to watch, and so long as Celine and Jesse are communicating, there's still hope.
Maybe we'll see more of them in another nine years. But if not, if things end here in this perfect trilogy, then that's enough to consider it as perhaps the greatest cinematic love story of all time.
Their persistent aggravation with each other indicates so much time spent together, so much intimacy and so little self-knowledge. (They misunderstand each other so well.)
This film explores the complexities and complications of modern love and life in an international setting with dialog that is smart and elegant, but it lacks the romance and sense of place featured in the first two films.
The movie's funny at times and difficult at others, and ends absolutely perfectly. The best of the three.
Delpy and Hawke talk and talk and talk but it is all fascinating.
An excellent statement (and warning) about the dangers of being in love with love.
Hawke and Delpy emerge multi-dimensional and riddled with flaws. In a long-term relationship, you may think you know what the other is thinking, but do you ever really know?
Like the other two, this is a film that breathes. It just holds on a little more before it's willing to exhale.
Like the Up series, a return to visit old friends
Making a movie with nothing more than smart dialogue and fine performances is a dying art, but Linklater, Hawke and Delpy remind us that it's a skill worth saving.
Before Midnight feels like the natural extension of the series, and will be everything fans of it could have hoped for.
The trouble with those first two film was their souffle-light scenarios...Here, however, things are much juicier as infidelity, commitment, divorce, resentment and all the other soul-sapping things that clock in when you hit your 40s come into play.
...in the surprising third act, the film comes together as a plausible horror show of how good intentions and real affection can give way to vicious, realistic psychic combat. (
...Before Midnight bears too few similarities to its thoroughly superior predecessors.
The reason this film will hold your attention for two hours is because of the natural dialogue between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.
Before Midnight is like an old friend who has grown sharper and grumpier and saltier with life; and for students of cinema, the film is a masterclass in the use of the language and tools of this amazing artform to portray human nature
The beauty of this film - like the two before - is its natural flow of conversation and ability to engage and transport us into the moment
The release of each sequel is becoming an event, so it's particularly great to see Before Midnight not only meeting expectations but raising the bar.
It's a brave, challenging and essential installment in what is one of modern cinema's finest trilogies.
