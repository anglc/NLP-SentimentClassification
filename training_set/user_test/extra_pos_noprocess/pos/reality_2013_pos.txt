It's clear that Garrone is lamenting the death of culture. But the movie is more compassionate than screed-y. It's a portrait of the preoccupation with fame in an age in which in fame is cheap.
A dark allegorical comedy about the nature of fame, about obsession, about madness - and the point where they converge: on Big Brother, a TV show watched by millions.
For all its ups and downs and occasional detours into boorishness, it's an original that will surprise if not necessarily delight fans of Garrone's very different crime drama, "Gomorrah."
Matteo Garrone follows his crime epic Gomorrah with a comedy about reality TV, and though it hardly rivals the earlier movie in its social complexity, it still offers the spectacle of a vibrant and vividly realized Neapolitan neighborhood.
As cautionary tales go, this one's ripely knowing, and it speaks in a lot more languages than Italian.
In this echo chamber of fame-for-fame's-sake, real life imitates reel life. There's a lurid, Felliniesque sheen to Garrone's floating camerawork; this is reality tweaked, dialed up to 10.1. And there's a cheeky, sideways satire of Roman Catholicism.
Reality is a little too thin to be truly satisfying. However, Garrone's elegant visual palette and Arena's remarkable central performance shift a potentially trite message into a gloriously warm and novel experience.
This movie shows a bit of the human costs of reality TV, but not the full extent of it.
Those who found Gomorrah embarrassingly overrated can relax. Despite a first half that's basically a spin-off of the 2008 movie that brought Matteo Garrone international acclaim, Reality turns out to be its veritable refutation.
... works on multiple levels and Arena, who worked within a prison release arrangement while serving a life sentence, creates an indelible, sad character.
Italian satire amusingly sends up our obsession with reality TV, but not in a wholly satisfying way.
It is a brutal, frank, painful and highly meticulous look at an ordinary man undergoing a very modern crisis amidst a very simple life.
Captures the 21st-century affliction of learned discontent, where perfectly happy people go in quest of something they think is better. Reality is a thoughtful, intelligent film.
Part fairy tale, part religious allegory, and part scathing indictment, but the comedy remains light.
Garrone has confounded expectations with this light, Fellini-esque send-up of reality television and the celebrity it has spawned.
A long and meandering satire on FOMO and self-delusion, and a shrewd commentary on the desire for the illusive fame that comes with reality television.
Felliniesque is a term that gets bandied about frequently, but few films actually capture the spirit of the Italian master in his prime. Matteo Garrone's Reality earns its keep without resorting to mere imitation.
