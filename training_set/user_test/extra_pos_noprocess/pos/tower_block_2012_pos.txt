Though suspension of disbelief is a pre-requisite, [this] is a rather gripping thriller...
It is an expertly crafted thriller with a mastery of tension-building techniques.
Gritty and claustrophobic, this British horror-thriller holds our interest with well-played characters rather than the wobbly plotting.
The ending is a letdown but this is still a very promising debut from directors James Nunn and Ronnie Thompson.
