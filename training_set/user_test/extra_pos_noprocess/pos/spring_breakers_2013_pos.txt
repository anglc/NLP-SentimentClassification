It's campy and comic at times, but Korine also gives the film a downbeat, melancholic edge, with voiceovers, pointed repetition of dialogue and images, and hallucinatory camera work, sound and editing.
Neon bright and all raw energy, Spring Breakers is a pulsating paradox of a movie, both a tangerine dream and a cultural reality check, a pop artifact that simultaneously exploits and explores the shallowness of pop artifacts.
Korine's story is a searing indictment of today's hedonistic, nihilistic youth, and his script is loaded with sharp, telling dialogue that exposes the rotten moral cores of its characters.
The film stands, overall, as one of the director's richer provocations ...
Korine's most entertaining film to date.
It's Malick-meets-dubstep amid post-"Kids"-skin-and-sin with the costumes of Pussy Riot and a sunset-by-the-sea Britney Spears sing-along by Alien and the girls that is both ridiculous and touching.
I'm not sure how many glow sticks died in the making of Spring Breakers, but I am sure that it was worth it.
A trippy, florescent whirl of boobs and bongs.
Often exploitative and completely gratuitous, it succeeds in also exploring the recklessness of youth...
Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers is rough around the edges, visually pleasing, experimental and a downright bizarre film, but one that's worthy of at least one viewing.
You're probably gonna hate Spring Breakers, but I bet you love it, too.
