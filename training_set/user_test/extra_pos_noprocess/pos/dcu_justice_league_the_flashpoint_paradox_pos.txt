The film feels unique and vibrant if only for the fact that it's the painfully rare DCAU title that doesn't revolve around Batman, Superman, or a Batman/Superman-led Justice League.
For all its apocalyptic fate-of-the-world theatrics, this...[adaptation of] the 2011 graphic novel Flashpoint by Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert...has an emotional core to give purpose to its crazy amounts of mayhem. [Blu-ray]
Years from now it may be looked at as the animated film that took the direct to video comic book movie market to another level of storytelling possibilities. Yes, it's that good.
