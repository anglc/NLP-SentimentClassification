Pleasant, if inane - helped along by a likable cast that's clearly having fun.
Saves itself from a complete belly flop by its good-natured charm.
It's often rote and by-the-numbers, but writer-director Tina Gordon Chism injects the proceedings with enough smart chat, clever situations and spot-on casting choices to make this well-traveled road feel a little less stale.
A meet-the-parents-and-their-rigid-disapproval comedy, with a bit of fish-out-of-water humor tossed in.
Boasts a great cast, plenty of sharp dialogue, and perhaps most importantly, a sincerity and warmth absent from the majority of studio comedies nowadays.
[Writer/director Tina Gordon Chism is ] good at low-key, observational humor, and the all-around excellent cast swings with aplomb from silly to sweet.
Funny but formulaic comedy has some edgy content.
Surely it would have been easier to shoot in Perry's home base of Atlanta, but the significant New England location places the movie at the geographical heart of America's origin story...
