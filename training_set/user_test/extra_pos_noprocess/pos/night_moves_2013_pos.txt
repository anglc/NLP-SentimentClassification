I'd say this is a movie about alienation that, in the spirit of the boldest activism, isn't afraid to be ostracized itself. You may beg to differ, and I'd say that's the point.
Reichardt wisely leaves it for her audience to decide.
"Night Moves" is an unexpected pleasure, offering more than what we expect and taking its time to deliver.
You may not buy the third-act developments, but Reichardt and her actors see to it that you believe in how these people got to that third act in the first place.
"Night Moves" is a study of murky actions, fuzzy ideals and wrong moves for righteous reasons.
The subdued acting combines with deliberate editing to slowly ratchet up viewers' nerves.
Impatient viewers are likely to complain that Night Moves is too slow and subdued for their tastes, but those in the market for an alternative thriller will find much to enjoy.
. A master at understatement, [director Kelly] Reichardt elicits very effective, subdued performances from her key cast, who have to keep the lid on their emotions almost all of the time.
It's a very well made film.
Jesse Eisenberg's performance has an intensity that is deliberately alienating, with Dakota Fanning and Peter Sarsgaard solid in support.
Virtually every shot feels like it adds to Reichardt's vision and it draws so tightly together that by the end, the only people left accessible to the likes of Josh are those in the watching audience. Night Moves makes you an accessory.
It's an unconventional thriller, more interested in character than plot, but gripping as both.

This is still a powerful film from one of America's best filmmakers who continues to push herself.
Eisenberg is in characteristically intense form, while Sarsgaard and Fanning are solid supports.
if a love of nature is (maybe) the original motor of Josh's actions, human nature, in all its shadowy complexity, is very much the film's focus.
This may be a slow-burning thriller about eco-terrorists, but it's also directed by Kelly Reichardt (Meek's Cutoff), a filmmaker who maintains an oddly aloof perspective while moving at her own steady pace.
Reichardt and regular co-writer Jon Raymond display a keen ear for the fragile rhetoric of the self-righteous.
Here is a thriller that portrays the heavy ramifications of a "justified" crime with a steady, grounded rhythm that gives power to every sin committed.
There certainly isn't any extraneous action in Night Moves. But it is precisely its leanness and the tight focus of its storytelling that make it such a tense thriller.
Reichardt probes away at her characters' motivations and contradictory feelings. She doesn't judge them, but makes it very clear how quickly their idealism becomes muddied once they dirty their hands with direct action.
Taking her cues from Hitchcock, Reichardt invites us to connect (if not quite empathise) with unlikable characters as they attempt to accomplish undesirable outcomes.
