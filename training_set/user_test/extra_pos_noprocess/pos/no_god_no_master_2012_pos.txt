[A] fairly engrossing historical drama.
Green is both a capable filmmaker and a clear history buff.
Nobody in No God, No Master actually utters the phrase "those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it," but that sentiment is the subtext of nearly every line of dialogue in this historical drama about the Palmer Raids.
Great history and plenty of bombs and explosions but lacking the glitz to be a great crime thriller.
"No God, No Master" is at its best when it sticks with Straithairn, who brings an added humanity to a role designed to celebrate the value of that very trait.
Although marred by a weak script and an obtrusive film score, this film is saved by its theme, namely the Palmer Raids of 1919 that was a precursor to the abuse of democratic rights happening right now.
[No God, No Master is] ambitious in a way that more expensive films are rarely allowed to be anymore, illuminating a fascinating, underexplored era of American history [...]
With this suppressed US history of rebellion, anarchism, the Palmer raids and the IWW resurrected at the movies, this moral thriller gets points for just existing. Even if somewhat a reticent victim itself of the government intimidation it indicts here.
Strathairn delivers even canned lines like they're fresh from the vine, and Ray Wise, as one of two characters without an accent, is again brilliant at being the most duplicitous man you can't beat with common sense or a stick.
