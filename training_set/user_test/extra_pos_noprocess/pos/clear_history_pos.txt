It will take only a few minutes of Clear History... not only to "forgive" David for repeating himself but to thank him for reminding us why we miss Curb Your Enthusiasm and hope it comes back soon.
[It] has a nice, confident and well-edited breeze to it (including a lot of jokes about the band Chicago), with a fun cast that includes standout riffs from Michael Keaton, Danny McBride and Eva Mendes.
A wonderfully diverting film with Mr. David at his abrasive best.
With a cast this capable and a screenplay invested in unusual topics for comedic dissection, the feature does just fine as a platform for David to continue his career quest to perfect the art of unease.
True to its improv style, the story meanders, but the jokes swirl and land more often than they miss
There's enough here to still merit a curious click, but Clear History may not be what hardcore David acolytes most crave.
'History' just doesn't have the same 'Curb' appeal. There's simply too many dead spots and too many ill-defined characters to make it pop.
The movie also feels at time like an extended all-star jam episode of Curb. Those are, perhaps not coincidentally, the best, and funniest parts of Clear History.
