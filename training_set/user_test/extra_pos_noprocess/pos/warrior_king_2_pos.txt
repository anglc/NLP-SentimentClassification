Eschews repugnant gore for a sly goofiness that makes Jaa come across like a real-life Looney Tunes character.
Sure, it's silly, but it's also wildly entertaining and sprinkled with some nice emotional beats. As long as Tony Jaa keeps losing his elephant, we'll keep showing up to watch him track it down.
It may not be the kind of film for which Tony Jaa will one day be remembered, but The Protector 2 is at least consistently fun.
This isn't a perfect movie, and it's not as strong as the original. However, as a follow-up, it's still a fun ride.
