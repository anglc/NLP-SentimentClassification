There's wonder here that films with quadruple the effects budget would kill for.
The film is more guileful than it looks, even though the narrative is nuts ...
No comedy classic, then, but a good natured and engaging slice of goonish self-mockery.
... the movie definitely struck a chord with the crowd I saw it with ... (with) a climax that brings bromance back ...
This Is the End, true to its subject matter, is as funny as hell.
Crass, flimsily plotted, and self-referential to the point of narcissistic personality disorder. For those willing to tolerate such defects, however, it is also very, very funny.
...runs on some delicious self-critique.
That Rogen and Goldberg make one of the Backstreet Boys' more annoying yesteryear hit singles something you giddily sing along to is a measure of just how on point the satire is--that, or that it truly *is* the end of the world.
Enjoyable, time-killing piece of throwaway Friday-night pap... It's broad, stupid fun that, against all odds, ends up coagulating into an actual story with a point.
...a very savvy send up of the way we perceive celebrities as vapid and self-involved ciphers who are so often flattered and coddled that they come to accept applause as their due.
If you're familiar with their previous films, you'll be laughing often and laughing loudly.
If Fast and Furious 6 was stupid in the bad way, This is the End is stupid in the best and funniest way.
An elaborate in-joke and everyone's in on the gag
It's a giant Hollywood in-joke, but one that invites you to share in the laughter.
One of the funniest films of the year so far.
Near-the-knuckle comedy that proves self-indulgent laughs, when done right, can be hilarious.
A funny self-aware critique of the actors' indulgences - along with several violent deaths, demonic monsters and dick jokes. There are lots of dick jokes.
This is the End is one of the most fun movies I've seen in ages. It's a silly extravaganza, a huge bunch of nonsense, but, boy, it's entertaining ... This film is one big in-joke, but it's a very good one.
Never reaches the heights of earlier collaborations Superbad and Pineapple Express. However, it has a belligerent, depraved, coked-up Michael Cera, and that is a treat unique to this film and this film only, so it's certainly worth your time.
While bewildering for those unfamiliar with the Judd Apatow clan, for fans, this raunchy, daring and gleeful comedy comes up trumps.
