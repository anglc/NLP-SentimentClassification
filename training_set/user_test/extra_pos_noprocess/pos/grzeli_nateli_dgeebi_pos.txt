Directors Nana Ekvtimshvili and Simon Gross adopt the long, contemplative takes of the new wave; much of the film feels familiar, but the location shooting and period details are nicely drawn, a result of Ekvtimshvili's autobiographical script.
The viewer becomes keenly aware that she is only getting part of the story. But when the truth is so troubling, sometimes part of the story is more than enough.
As arthouse coming-of-age films go, this is brilliant -- smart and sensitive with a screw-you feminist streak.
Despite the seeming inevitability of tragedy and despair, "In Bloom" remains true to its title.
The world painted by directors Nana Ekvtimishvili and Simon GroB is almost relentlessly grim, and even the giggles of two schoolgirls get drowned.
There are moments that are powerful to Ekvtimishvili that are more likely merely glancing to the audience, but the unadorned performances and air of unease combine for a film rich in social realism.
Portraying lives a universe away from the malls and frippery of their Western counterparts, Eka (Lika Babluani) and Natia (Mariam Bokeria) cope with food shortages, bullying, bad families, a ramshackle education system [and] forced marriages.
The young actresses however are sublime in their roles.
This is a story of adolescence and female friendship under pressure, explored with a quietly engrossing combination of familiarity and strangeness.
Babluani and Bokeria are completely believable as the two teenagers who have to grow up very quickly, and a long, uninterrupted scene in which the former dances, alone, at her friend's wedding is a highlight of an extremely engaging movie.
Teen life in In Bloom is tense, terse, gritty, and galvanising, but for its characters, heartbreakingly, there is no other alternative.
The two nonprofessional actresses shine.
The centrifugal force is supplied by two stunning lead turns by Babluani and Bokeria.
As civility and sympathy prove to be in ... short supply, the girls' unwavering devotion to each other makes for absorbing drama.
This terrifically engaging work raises important questions about universal experience and cultural context - in this case, the search for independent female identity in a society all but suffocated by the threat of violence.
Bold and brassy, Georgia's Best Foreign Film entry may not be the cheeriest viewing but it's still a compelling coming-of-age drama.
Unpredictable, never forced, and forever compelling.
This tense and naturalistic tale of Georgian youth in revolt offers a clever new twist on the tired teen movie.
Co-director Nana Ekvtimishvili's script, nurtured on memories of her own childhood, becomes more focused, even sourly funny, as it evolves.
Among the best features to come recently out of Eastern Europe, featuring the tough-minded cinematography of Romania's Oleg Matu, who shot 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days.
