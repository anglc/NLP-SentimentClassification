A relatively alluring period drama set in an artist's colony in Cornwall in 1913.
Summer in February is a well-made costume drama that fans of Downton Abbey will probably appreciate, while those hoping to learn about Munnings will be better off hitting the nearest museum.
The film is at its best when the majestic countryside and the blossoming romance combine perfectly.
