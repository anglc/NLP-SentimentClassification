It's weirdly compelling.
[It wows] cult fans, connoisseurs of the absurd, and cinephiles intrigued by the evolution of the sci-fi and horror genres in the '70s and '80s.
Perhaps the most fun you can have in a movie theater without risking permanent brain damage.
The great surprise is how, consistency be damned, these individual sequences fascinate.
Lysergically painted-and-composited backgrounds & lo-fi light shows bring a striking if cheesy otherworldliness to the film's alien elements; and the film's cosmic duels are carried out neither with fire and brimstone nor laser guns....
It's a visitor from another world of filmmaking.
It's far from the cerebral fare it was meant to be, but for fans of foreign knock-offs and impressively weird b-movies, The Visitor is a must-see.
Never makes much sense even when it at times seems to make some sense.
The movie suggests that contrary to Cassius' claim, the fault is not in ourselves but in our stars -- that, as the paranoid and psychotic have suspected, our unhappiness is the collateral damage of an eternal and cosmic struggle.
Paradisi may not have a clue about directing actors... but he has picked up a few tricks from Argento on how to move a camera and from Fulci on how to stage a supernatural freak-out.
The Visitor doesn't come close to answering all the questions it raises, but that's the film's M.O.: If nothing makes sense, then nothing is off limits.
THE VISITOR returns from 1979 to peck out your eyes and make you like it
You'll likely you ask yourself just what you're watching several times...Whether that's a good or a bad thing is a matter of opinion, and there's a chance you'll change your mind on the subject.
