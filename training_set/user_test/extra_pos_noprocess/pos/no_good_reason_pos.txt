Meet Ralph Steadman and his nightmare visions of a world in pain, revealed in a mesmerizing documentary.
The film makes it clear that not only was Steadman perfect for Thompson's work (and a big part of his success), his work stands on its own artistically.
Giving an overlooked luminary his due is reason enough for "For No Good Reason."
As wonderful as it is to watch the man work, and to review many of the startling images he created over the years, the film has its dead spots.
This is most worthwhile for its scenes of Steadman at work, flinging ink all over the place and turning the splatter marks into his signature grotesques.
The process of creating a painting isn't as automatically intertesting as, say, that of making a film, but...the technical and artistic inspirations that fuel an artist can sometimes be as fascinating as the finished work.
It's satisfying that the film exists, as an overdue tribute to an artist who can be appreciated even by those with limited patience for Thompson's posturing prose.
[For No Good Reason] paints a strong portrait of the illustrator through archival footage, photography, and long discussions with Steadman about his artistic process.
A film for admirers of artist Ralph Steadman, people whose politics align with Steadman's politics and the most devoted followers of Steadman's celebrity fan, Johnny Depp.
It's most compelling when the focus is on Steadman, allowing him to describe his feelings about fame and his artistic process - or perhaps more accurately, the method to his madness.
Though friendly and humorous in his jaunty nautical cap, Steadman seems reluctant to give much away about his private life. Fortunately his work - scabrous, anarchic and utterly merciless - more than speaks for itself.
The film has some slow spots; at times, it reaches pretention, but overall it is an interesting portrait of a contradictory individual who is proud of his work, yet questions whether or not it had any impact on the world.
For 89 madcap minutes, Paul and interviewer Johnny Depp conduct a surface-level whistle-stop tour of the artist's life, never once outstaying our curiosity.
Even if we don't quite get to know the man, the visionary violence of Steadman's acid pen emerges to vivid effect, partly though Kevin Richards's animations, and despite Depp's sometimes over-eager respect.
