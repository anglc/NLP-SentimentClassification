Following their smash-hit Basic Instinct, director Paul Verhoeven and writer Joe Eszterhas tried to shock cinemagoers with this sensational look at the sleazy world of Las Vegas strips clubs and showgirl casino spectaculars. Audiences and critics were shocked all right. They were shocked at Eszterhas' ludicrously "hard-hitting" dialogue about who has nice breasts, who is a whore, who finds it hard to adjust to no longer being ejaculated on. They were shocked at Verhoeven thinking we'd be turned on by Elizabeth Berkley and Kyle MacLachlan making love in a neon-lit pool like they'd been set on the spin cycle. Most of all they were shocked that this supposedly erotic drama generated nothing but guffaws.
