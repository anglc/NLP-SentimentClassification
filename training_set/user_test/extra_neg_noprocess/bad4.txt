You can keep Ghost and Dirty Dancing. After Point Break, this is the late Patrick Swayze's best movie, even though it's not, at least by the usual standards, a "good" film. Who in their right mind could possibly believe a story about a world-famous bouncer who's also a pacifist philosopher? Who cares! Swayze as high-kicking, throat-tearing Dalton is cheer-along fantastic. He's given awesome support from Sam Elliott and Ben Gazzara.
