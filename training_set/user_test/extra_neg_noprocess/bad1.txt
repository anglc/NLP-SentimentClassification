Forget the scares and deliberate laughs of Joe Dante's 1981 original. This sequel, from Aussie director Philippe Mora, was shot in Soviet-controlled Prague and is a hilariously bad confection of erotic horror and New Wave "style." Christopher Lee, years off his blockbuster comeback, stars as an occult investigator who has to take on Sybil Danning's werewolf Queen Stirba and her minions. What's worse? The cotton-candy special make-up effects, the "acting" of co-stars Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe, or the seemingly endlessly repeated electro-bleating of the theme song by Babel? It's a big call. Whichever way you go, don't switch off before the very "special" end credits featuring Sybil Danning's assets -- on repeat loop.
