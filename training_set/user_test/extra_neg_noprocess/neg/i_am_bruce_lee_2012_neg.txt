Lee's legions of fans might get a kick out of this, but newcomers would do better to invest in a DVD of 'Fist of Fury'.
It's safe to say that every inch of Bruce Lee's legacy has been covered and I Am Bruce Lee is just an excessive amount of icing added to an already well decorated cake.
Its odd agenda rather overshadows some fascinating archive footage and reminiscences from Lee's family.
Baggy, braying and kinda unhelpful, this one is strictly for paid-up Lee lovers.
