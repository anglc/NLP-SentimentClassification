The film's anthropological interest in Indonesia is the smartest thing in an otherwise familiar scramble of kidnapped babes, expensive jewelry and millions of bullets.
The potential fun is all thoroughly undone, however, by an eye-roller of a script and a leaden lead performance from Twilight heartthrob Kellan Lutz.
Lutz ... doesn't have half the charisma required to hold together this jumble of cheesy shootouts and chases, but at least Rourke provides some unintended laughs with his comical attempts to be evil.
A better title for "Java Heat" might have been "Java Noise," since that is mostly what this uninvolving action film produces.
This otherwise generic '80s-style actioner benefits from the presence of the ever-colorful Mickey Rourke as an exotic villian.
Remember all those years when Mickey Rourke was languishing in cheap, straight-to-DVD work that paid his rent and wasted his talents? Apparently, he actually enjoyed making those movies.
a wretched mess of an action film
Despite some appealing exotic locales, the action sequences and plot twists are right off the genre assembly line.
It's violent enough to numb, but Allyn doesn't launch the effort to rousing heights of escapism. In the end, Java Heat works better as a travelogue than an international actioner.
A middling genre movie, but it's oddly likable for its conflicted, unresolved tension.
