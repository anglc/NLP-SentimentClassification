Most of the logic has leached away from this movie, and with it half of the fun.
For all its chasing and falling and fighting-and the movie supplies a great deal of each-Star Trek Into Darkness is at its best when the Enterprise crew are merely bickering and bantering among themselves: less space opera than soap opera.
J.J. Abrams' Star Trek Into Darkness is a bigger and much louder sequel, which sacrifices brains and character building for expensive spectacle.
Suggests someone painting by numbers with Herculian intensity, and the effect is hollow and dispassionate.
Far from going where no one has gone before, this Star Trek is only interested in retreating along its old tracks.
Either reinvent or stick to the source material, don't try to have your fun both ways. It doesn't work.
