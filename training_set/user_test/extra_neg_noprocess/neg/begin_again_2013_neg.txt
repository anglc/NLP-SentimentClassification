The trouble with this movie -- aside from its lack of visual wonder and musical shape -- is that you don't trust its priorities.
Begin Again is a not-entirely-successful movie about not selling out; it's a theme that must concern Carney deeply.
The best thing about 'Begin Again' is what it's not. It's not a love story, or at least not a conventional love story; it's more of a friendship story between a man and a woman, which is something we almost never see in movies.
