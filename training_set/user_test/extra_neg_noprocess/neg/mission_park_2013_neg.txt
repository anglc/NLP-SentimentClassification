If real F.B.I. agents were as inept as those in "Mission Park," their average on-the-job life span would approximate that of a very lucky mayfly. And if actual drug honchos were as careless as the ones presented here, we wouldn't need the F.B.I.
An earnest, not terribly convincing action thriller as generic as its title.
You probably saw the ensuing narrative of betrayal, murder, and undercover investigation on Silk Stalkings, Miami Vice, 21 Jump Street, Hardcastle and McCormick, Profiler, or The Cosby Mysteries.
This mission is a bit stilted from beginning to end.
Four young men from a rough neighborhood are bound together by an ugly secret that continues to haunt them long after they've taken different paths to adulthood... Feel free to stop us if you've heard this story, oh, about a hundred times before.
