Worth enduring only for a rare lead performance by Paul Giamatti, whose expert delineation of rage and frustration lends form to Morrison's otherwise shapeless script.
Morrison films this redemptive story - which has some hard-to-swallow moments - with a dusty gray palette that suits its characters and masquerades the story's more obvious sentimentality.
"All is Bright is nothing more than empty threats and bottomless desires haphazardly thrown together around a more interesting event that you never get to see.
Overall, it's truly as exciting as you'd think watching two people sell Christmas trees would be, even if those two people are Paul Giamatti and Paul Rudd.
There's the backbone of a better film here, it just needs some ornaments.
a relatively lackluster dark comedy that is elevated several notches by Giamatti's cantankerous presence
The entire enterprise feels as phony as a fake Yule tree
It's certainly missing some holiday cheer.
I wish I could give four stars to Giamatti's big, sad eyes and outrageous Civil War beard.
