A modest effort only fitfully attaining its aims.
An especially hollow Armageddon, in which the final battle between good and evil is as flavorless and thinly structured as a Communion wafer.
The real problem with this film is that its voiceover at the beginning is its only real attempt at storytelling; there is no central character or quest to latch onto.
