Why do invading extra-terrestrials always bring with them the single thing that can wipe them out? Couldn't they have hid it on Jupiter or something?
It's the writing and plotting in "Edge of Tomorrow" that sucks. Not the staging of scenes. Not the film's sense of humor. Not the film's quality action sequences.
