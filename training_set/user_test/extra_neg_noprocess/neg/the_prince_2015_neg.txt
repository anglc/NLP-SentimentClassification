If filmmakers were put on trial for hackery, a good prosecutor might ask director Miller why The Prince contains no discernible prince but does feature a closing-credit shout-out to "Prince Yoohanhwesa."
Unless you're a fan of yawn-worthy shootouts and showdowns, "The Prince" is a "Taken" retread hardly indicative of any special set of skills.
An idle Netflix user could certainly do far worse when browsing for mindless actioners. But the overall air of shrugging obligation from those both in front of and behind the camera proves contagious.
'Taken' without any of the charisma or energy.
Originality, either in terms of writing or direction, in in short supply in this assembly-line vigilante thriller.
The Prince is a royal dud.
