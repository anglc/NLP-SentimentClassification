Here is a movie that, much like its eponymous character, never quite figures out what it wants to be.
What could have been a very funny short film about self-control and befriending your id instead becomes a rambling commentary on father-son dysfunction and the limits of proctology.
Like a lot of intentionally shoddy or derivative movies, Bad Milo! can't overcome what it's trying to be.
Bad Milo! meets your expectations right where you left them.
The idea of watching Ken Marino argue with a giant haemorrhoid monster that has just popped out of his butt seems like a crazy must-see moment. Unfortunately, it comes across as flat and uninspired.
This is the year's best movie about things that come out of your rear end, which is praise that's meant to be as faint as it sounds.
Bad Milo! is one bad ass movie-as opposed to a badass one.
The concept runs out of gas well before the end despite the best efforts of Marino and an eclectic supporting cast.
Bad Milo probably wanted to be gleefully naughty, but instead it's just bad.
Except for the premise of human anxiety creating organic instruments of wrath and revenge (should Cronenberg sue?), Bad Milo is just a pain from the posterior.
Fitfully amusing, as midnight movies about avenging anus dwellers go.
