All of Black Nativity proceeds with sort of clumsy obviousness.
By the time the credits rolled, my eyes were sore from all the rolling.
Takes Hughes' nativity story and shoves it into the far background of a sincere but tritely told modern drama about family, faith, and redemption.
To call it preachy isn't necessarily a critique; the entire film is essentially built around a closing sermon.
Jennifer Hudson sings like an angel but the movie is not up to that level storywise.
This story of seasonal healing ultimately feels too predictable and heavy-handed to bring much uplifting Christmas cheer.
To my eyes, Black Nativity is the cinematic equivalent of a Christmas tree ornament: shiny, hollow, sheathed in decorative, artificial linings, mass-produced and, given the cost of today's movie theater tickets, overpriced.
Hudson's singing and Whitaker's acting compensate somewhat, but for a truly inventive and uplifting African-American piece set in New York during the Yuletide season, skip Black Nativity and watch Run-DMC's "Christmas in Hollis" music video instead.
An inept, often ludicrous, take on Langston Hughes' 1961 musical-play.
Whitaker's performance is one of only a few positives, as a film that ends on such an illusory, elaborate and downright absurd finale.
Points for dogged credulity: whether trying to pass off Times Square as Judea or Tyrese "Fast & Furious" Gibson as the Angel Gabriel, it sincerely believes it. You, of course, are at liberty not to.
It's a misguided enterprise all round, and while it's perfectly possible to applaud everything the film wants to say, you find yourself cringing at the ways it's saying it.
Lemmons' refusal to go for cheap laughs and easy uplift places her at odds with the cliched and predictable aspects of her own screenplay. The movie overall is earnest and respectful but unexciting
Despite the odd rip-roaring tune and some sturdy performances, this yuletide tale is as memorable as last year's sprouts.
