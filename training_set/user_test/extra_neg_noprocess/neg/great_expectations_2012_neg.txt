The crucial central roles go wanting.
It's not clear what this re-do adds except another line to these actors' resumes.
While Mike Newell's adaptation of "Great Expectations" isn't a terrible one by any means, there just isn't enough here to make it worth the time of sitting through a story that's already been done many times over.
... has the feel of a very well done History Channel production. Which doesn't make it bad, only superfluous.
In a culture already awash with so much Dickens, another take on 'Great Expectations' needs to be a real pip (forgive me) to be worth the trouble.
It somehow feels more suited for the 'Masterpiece Theatre' crowd than for the multiplex.
A BBC- or PBS-caliber television movie that, while atmospheric, does not have a ton of production values beyond Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter, giving boisterous performances in pivotal roles.
Missing the connective tissue that's served previous adaptations so well. Without dramatic strength, Newell has created a museum piece, best presented on mute.
The latest film version of Dickens' novel offers nothing new except a chance to see another generation of talented hams tackle its memorable characters.
As the pages turn faster, focusing on the hows and whys of a major crime central to the plot, this concision and velocity make the film feel like a modern thriller. Booo.
