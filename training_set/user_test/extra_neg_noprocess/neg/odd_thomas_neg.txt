Yep, he's an odd one all right. You're likely to get tired of hearing about it pretty quick, though.
At once comic, tragic and goofily romantic, and resting too often on Odd's clarifying narration, this young-adult lark breaches the nonsense barrier with some regularity.
Odd Thomas has high-speed chases, explosions, narrow escapes and masses of special effects-none special enough, I'm afraid, to save it from mediocrity.
This expensive-looking indie, adapted from a supernatural book series by sci-fi author Dean Koontz, tries too hard for a wacky tone, and winds up merely brain-dead.
Nightmarish imagery, violence abounds in dark-humored tale.
The film fails to establish a consistent tone and never becomes truly funny or scary as a result.
It feels smaller and more rushed - and less plausible - than it should, but Anton Yelchin is charming, and the snappy comic tone sometimes works.
The film never really veers enough away from Buffy The Vampire Slayer territory to mark it as a serious groundbreaking genre contender.
[Stephen] Sommers might be the worst director working who's not Uwe Boll, who at least has accidental charm.
Odd Thomas should have been a scary horror movie with comic overtones, or a flat-out comedy with horror overtones. Instead, Sommers opts for a live-action version of a dumbed-down Scooby Doo adventure.
He sees dead people. She works in an ice cream shop. Limited release without MPAA rating? What gives?
They've given this once-promising character a fate similar to death-a pretty bad movie.
Odd Thomas is a sloppy mixture of what could otherwise be a fun thriller. It's like a really lazy rip off of Peter Jackson's The Frighteners if it was made 18 years too late.
Isn't terrible, but it tries much too hard to be hip and sassy while telling a story that, to be honest, is far less fresh than it wants to be.
