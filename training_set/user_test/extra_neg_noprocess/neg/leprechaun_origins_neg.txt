I'm not going to pretend the original movies were classics, but they definitely won't lull you to sleep like "Origins."
Davis's performance, his sense of theatricality, and his villainous make-up are deeply missed.
Leprechaun: Origins isn't just bad - it's downright insulting. Lipovski's film is nothing but a series of bad choices, worse execution and infuriating redundancy, highlighting the ugliness that comes along with exploiting horror instead of respecting it.
Even the cheapest, most shoddy productions can manage some thrills, kills, and laughs with memorable characters and a cohesive plot when skilled filmmakers are at the helm. Leprechaun: Origins, unfortunately, offers none of these things.
