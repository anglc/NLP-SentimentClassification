Good People provides the degree of entertainment one expects while sitting on a sofa watching a direct-to-video effort rather than the higher standards one sets for paying $10 for a movie ticket.
"Good People" goes from being simply pedestrian to outright preposterous without batting an eye.
James Franco and Kate Hudson are uncharacteristically muted in this watchable but wholly unsurprising London crime caper.
Good People grinds to its predictable, pat conclusion and betrays its generally solid performances and respectable artistic pedigree. Sometimes good people do bad things, sometimes they just make movies that start well and end badly.
Good People might have been better titled Dumb People, or at least People Who Have Never Seen A Movie In Their Entire Lives.
They're good people, all right-but pretty stupid.
They might be good people, but they make a bad movie in the case of this generic thriller.
If it managed to at least be a consistently thrilling ride, none of that would matter, but intermittently good just isn't good enough.
Weirdness is exactly what Good People needs, providing something diverting to break relentless formula that dries out the excitement that has managed to survive the brutal editorial process.
Feels like a half-hearted jumble, full of lazy shortcuts.
Mindless and mechanical until it suddenly decides to abandon any pretense of sense in a pulpy third act that hints in the faintest fashion at the deranged fun the film could have been ...
Good People ... thinks it's a lot smarter than it really is.
An attempt at a modern noir that works its way to a pretty exciting, if absurd, climax but mostly bides time until then.
It's engaging enough while one is watching it, but not distinctive enough to make it special, or, in this case, enthusiastically recommendable.
Decent cast, seriously hackneyed story
It only overcomes its deficiencies and gains a modicum of entertainment value precisely when it commits to its illogical storylines and exaggerated plot twists.
