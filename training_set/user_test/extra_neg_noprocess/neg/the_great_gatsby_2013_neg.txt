For all the antic, manic itchiness of his Gatsby, for all the jazz hands, the movie doesn't reach out and grab you.
It's stupefying, it's vulgar, it's demeaning-it's dull and there's nothing like the dullness that is trying to be a sensation.
There are no two ways about it: The Great Gatsby is misconceived and misjudged, a crude burlesque on what's probably American literature's most precious jewel.
The central problem with Luhrmann's film is that when it's entertaining it's not Gatsby, and when it's Gatsby it's not entertaining.
A failure that should have at least been a magnificent mistake.
...of such bacchanalian proportions that it requires an act of will to sit there passively as the senses are not merely assaulted but pummeled into submission. It's akin to watching a play staged on a carousel.
As a filmmaker, Baz has fine technical knowledge but he never knows when to call cut.
Leonardo DiCaprio is wrong as Jay Gatsby but right when, momentarily embarrassed for once, he stammers that 'this is a terrible mistake.'
Just because a film looks like it was dipped in 18-karat gold doesn't mean it's rich in quality
Alternately intriguing and infuriating: it's very like the sort of movie exuberantly excessive Gatsby himself might have made.
This is kitsch at such a deep level it doesn't even seem to be aware that it's kitsch.
Almost 100 percent faithful to the novel in terms of plot, and almost zero percent faithful in terms of theme, character, and impact.
This take, pimped out in 3D spectacle and one woozy romance, renders the '20s as backdrop and swerves around the book's period-politics. A surreal slice-of-a-1922-summer overbaked into maximalist fantasia. The narrative frame is silly; the pacing is off.
The Great Gatsby is Baz Luhrman's visual tribute album to the novel; and it's only in his filmmaking comfort zones that any of the essence of the text elevates beyond karaoke.
Adapting Gatsby just so you can recreate the party scenes is like remaking Born on the Fourth of July for the war scenes. Luhrmann has a knack for missing the point.
...as disastrous and pointless an adaptation as one can easily recall...
If Fitzgerald's Jazz Age classic is the Great American Novel, then this frantically jazzed-up 3D film is the pop-up-book version.
Though it is quite possible that the neutered feel of Luhrmann's Gatsby is entirely due to studio meddling, the finished product isn't enjoyable, either as campy fun or a serious attempt at dismantling the American dream.
