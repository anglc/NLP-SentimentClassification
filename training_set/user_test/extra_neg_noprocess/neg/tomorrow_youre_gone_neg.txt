There are intimations throughout that Charlie may not have the strongest grip on reality, though there's nothing ambiguous about the picture's overriding tedium.
This turgid and pretentious thriller is all style, no substance.
The makers of "Tomorrow You're Gone" were definitely going for a specific something with the film. The question is - why?
Tomorrow You're Gone looks like it was made after reading the first chapter of Noir for Dummies.
For some reason, Stephen Dorff has been cast yet again as... anybody.
It's almost as if Jacobson and writer Matthew F. Jones changed their minds at the last minute, leaving us all in the lurch.
Whilst Dorff is fairly blank in the central role, Monaghan is superb, creating a character whose unlikeliness doesn't detract from her believability.
Stephen Dorff struggles to rise above the plainness of the film's premise.
Assuming a series of increasingly empty noir postures and grimaces, Dorff expedites the plunge into frustrating pointlessness of this curious psychological drama.
A stylized neo-noir that goes nowhere slowly.
Tomorrow You're Gone may be overly confusing from start to finish, but there's no confusion about the fact that it's simply not very good.
Despite its great cast, this murky thriller disappoints because of a lack of cohesiveness and less than stellar production values.
The movie tries to achieve something we've seen done so much better in the past without the level of writing necessary to make it work.
Hardboiled noir play-acting doesn't get more sluggish than in this leaden tale that blurs the line between reality and delusion in a way that's less intriguing than simply confusing.
