Taylor and Burton deserved better, and Lohan should have shed her protective shell and made an effort to try and understand a psyche other than her own.
Bowler and Lohan never approach the kind of magnetism that a movie about Burton and Taylor must conjure in order to be convincing.
It feels throughout like those behind it made a deliberately campy, dumb, over-the-top and wildly unconvincing film to satisfy the whims of an audience eager to laugh at, rather than with, it.
