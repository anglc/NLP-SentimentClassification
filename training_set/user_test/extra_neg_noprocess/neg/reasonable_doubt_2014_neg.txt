Cooper and Jackson never really develop as characters, and the film hurtles towards a pat, violent conclusion.
Had Mr. Croudins focused more on Mitch's desire to distance himself from a wrong-side-of-the-tracks upbringing - and less on ticking genre boxes - his movie could only have been the better for it.
It moves fast (a rare quality for a contemporary thriller), but doesn't end up going anywhere interesting.
There's no doubt in my mind that this dull, preposterous mess will be gone from my memory by this time tomorrow night.
A mindfield of idiocy and neglect in this poorly executed thriller. Truthfully, everyone is to blame. Only Howitt had the right idea to peel his name off the finished product.
A ramshackle delivery vehicle for Dominic Cooper's misadventures in accent and the sort of disinterested glowering that Samuel L. Jackson reliably pulls out for paycheck gigs.
You may feel as if you're watching two or three abbreviated episodes of Law & Order in quick succession rather than a fully realized movie.
