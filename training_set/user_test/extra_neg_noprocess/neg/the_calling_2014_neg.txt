What not even Sutherland can do, and which eventually makes you want to lie down on the floor just like Sarandon, is make The Calling convincing or compelling.
Basically this is the story of some major talents having to make do, once again, with a minor film. And that's a crime too, if not quite a sin.
Here's a mystery: what the heck is Susan Sarandon doing north of the border in a low-budget Canadian thriller called The Calling?
"The Calling" aims to unsettle, but when a movie primarily leaves you wanting to learn more about the jurisdictional conflicts of Canadian law, it can't properly be called a thriller.
The dread barely bobs above sea level, despite efficient performances from Sarandon and the talented, underworked supporting cast.
The Canadian serial-killer-hunt script is less satisfying and heavily signposted throughout, so that even Sarandon's Detective Hazel Micallef seems a bit bored by it and sends out her new deputy (Topher Grace) to do most of the legwork.
There is almost nothing about The Calling that sets it aside from a hundreds of crime thrillers that are churned out from Hollywood year in, year out.
The Calling isn't so much an awful film as a flat and unremarkable one ...
It's handsomely shot, filmed with a crisp, chilly edge and plenty of natural light. But the visual realism locks horns with a ruinously predictable - and increasingly silly - narrative.
Too one-dimensional to be a character study, and too dull to be a thriller, The Calling is disappointing not just because of its bland, procedural tone but also because it completely wastes a truly impressive cast.
The Calling seems like it might be trying to be a horror flick for the Fargo set.
