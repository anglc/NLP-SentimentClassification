The movie's only fresh element is the wintry setting, which shrouds everything in a mood of weary fatalism. Otherwise, it's the same old, same old, efficiently discharged and utterly disposable.
The movie's late-night cable feel and skeevy salaciousness grinds everything to a snowy slush.
Although writer-director Scott Walker seems committed to not overly exploiting his lurid subject matter, the movie is just too dreary, disjointed and generically creepy to be persuasive.
A vague and forgettable crime thriller that would have benefited from more character development or at least a grounding of the narrative in one central protagonist.
The Frozen Ground hits the familiar notes.
It's all around safe and plain, simple and to the point, and all very, very by-the-numbers.
The scenes where Cage grills Cusack are the best thing about this very average thriller.
Choppy and chilling, it's destined for a quick burial in the icy tundra.
Are we mourning the loss of these women or delighting in their downfall, relishing their abuse? Cheap thrills destroy whatever pure intentions launched Ground, chaining the effort to the most banal of B-movie pursuits.
Unfortunately, with a confusing script pocked with plot holes, The Frozen Ground misses an opportunity to create a lasting testament to their memories.
Unfocused, flitting back and forth from separate Cage, Cusack, and Hudgens arcs without forming them into one vision.
