an insufferable family adventure whose impressive animation is consistently undercut by cartoonish self-awareness.
The only solace from the uninspired characters and crammed-in factoids are the gags about poop and puke - juvenile, yes, but also appropriate for the film's "back to nature" ethos.
You'd think it'd be hard to screw up a movie about dinosaurs, and yet Hollywood keeps doing so.
You could write "Walking With Dinosaurs'' off as harmless filler for the under-5 set, except that the only female dinosaur, Juniper, exists solely to moon over Patchi, who as a hatchling lost part of an ear to a winged predator.
Collee piles on references to such distinctly human concepts as ninjas and ballet, while 21st-century expressions ("Worst migration ever!") and a forgettable selection of pop tunes feel instantly biodegradable.
"(A)beautifully animated but plot-thin kids film that borrows heavily in the story department from both the Land Before Time and Ice Age movies, as well as various Disney animated classics."
Walking with Dinosaurs 3D has gorgeous, meticulously detailed CGI, but also way too many stupid jokes about poop and puke.
Basically Fox took a concept with wide appeal and reduced it to children's fare.
I realize scientists can't prove dinosaurs didn't communicate telepathically, but I suspect the filmmakers' decision to go telepathic stems more from financial concerns than artistic or scientific ones.
Some of the character transformations are rushed (such as that of Patchi's older brother) and I don't quite think there's enough here to keep youngsters entertained.
As I gazed, slack-jawed, at the fantastic visuals of wWalking With Dinosaurs,' I could not fathom how it came to be paired with the hideous, low-brow dialogue. And then I think I figured it out.
The film should have been called Walking Very Slowly With Dinosaurs. And as well as being shown in 2D and 3D, the posters should have included that the film can also be seen in Zero D, which is the format you experience the film in when you fall asleep.
With no attempt at lip-synching, the detachment of the voices from the main characters is more supernatural than 3D.
An educational show with the addition of a moronic plot and a lot of poop and flatulence gags.
Unfortunately dopey, it's a nonsensical, mind-numbing disappointment.
My dream has always been to "Walk with Dinosaurs", but if they're this shallow and annoying, I'll just stick with looking at their skeletons.
Sure, it's aimed at kids, but as much as they all love dinosaurs...subjecting them to a film this annoying won't do anything but dampen that enthusiasm.
Hey kids. Do you want to have fun and learn at the same time? Do you? Do you? Of course you don't.
An ambitious effort to meld learning and entertainment that ultimately works as neither.
