Nice as it would be to herald Tusk as a return to Smith's bold early period, the movie has a lurching tone and an airless atmosphere.
"Excess" is Smith's middle name, so the show goes on . . . and on.
Tusk is not a particularly good movie, but the vivid anxiety dream at its heart makes it one of the most personal films this writer-director has ever made.
Tusk is an overextended, tonally incoherent joke that would make viewers squirm even if it didn't involve a bloody and demented medical experiment.
The basic idea is great for a horror comedy. The results are just a sick joke that went on too long.
Without a doubt, "Tusk" joins "Cop Out" at the very bottom of Kevin Smith's filmography, being nothing more than a grotesque, unengaging, and overstretched film that's easily a prime candidate for the worst picture of 2014.
It's an excruciating experience...
Given how good Smith can be with actors, it's a surprise he didn't make good on the promise of his premise and turn this into a full-blooded comic-horror lark. The first half-hour of Tusk has some terrifically creepy moments that are just not paid off.
Veteran American indie filmmaker Kevin Smith tries his hand at semi-sinister horror with Tusk, a so-so offering where cleverness is often cancelled out by laziness.
Parts of it are funny, parts are suspenseful and parts of it - to put it mildly - are hideously awful. Horrible may be a better word than horrific.
Is Kevin Smith's Tusk the worst movie of the year? Yes. I mean, probably. ... none have made me quite as angrily resentful of a filmmaker as this one did.
Kevin Smith gets his weird on
It's an agreeably insane plot, which is hilarious if you're high, but the problem is the premise doesn't even come close to sustaining a feature length story.
I thought this was a really pointless exercise.
It's a crunchy mix that doesn't prove all that funny, especially since the most horrific parts of the story were true for so many and most of the historical names are mispronounced, making it all feel needlessly glib.
Considering how supergonzo it is, I'm surprised I didn't like it more.
