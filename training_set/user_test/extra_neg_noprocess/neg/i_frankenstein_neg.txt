It's no fun. Everyone takes this way too seriously.
What the film doesn't have is a sense of humor.
The special effects are pretty good and the fight scenes are adequate. But the film loses steam in the fourth act ...
Stitches up Aaron Eckhart's chiseled face like a baseball cover, sticks him in a hoodie, and promptly crashes, thanks to a complete inability to resist awful, overdone dialogue and faux-lofty exposition.
If the film is made with the understanding that campiness needs to be straight-faced to be funny, then are its "unintentional" laughs really that unintentional?
Here's hoping there's no follow-up to the amazingly dull adventures of Frankenstein's Monster.
It takes less than four minutes to realise that this Underworld-style, graphic novel adaptation won't keep anyone in the audience sitting bolt upright for long.
Humanity's fate hangs in the balance, but it's hard to work up much excitement for the routine CGI-boosted battles between good and evil forces, or for the less than sparky rapport between Eckhart's Monster and Strahovski's lissome blonde scientist.
I, Frankenstein leaves itself open to be franchised, but the chances of that happening are equal to Eckhart putting this film at the top of his resume.
Even the title card is garish
Even the most avid action junkies would have a hard time not rolling their eyes at the blandness of it all.
If a worse studio film comes out this year, we're in deep trouble, people. This film is so bad it will hurt your brain. And even if you leave your brain at home, your spinal column will still object...[a] godawful, lame-brained mess of a movie.
I, Frankenstein, with its monster reinvented as a superhero, is a fairly predictable action movie. Shelley would not have approved.
Only in occasional, uncanny moments - when someone uses an iPhone, or gets off a tram - does this world appear to intersect in any way with our own.
Mary Shelley's words come to mind: "Oh, why did you create me!"
It is disappointing and you look at all the talent that's gone into it. I was really underwhelmed by Strahovski's performance, I must say.
The numerous battles are confusingly handled and the actors aren't given many opportunities given the dialogue they're forced to speak.
Devoid of any appeal that isn't concentrated around star Aaron Eckhart's impeccably-sculpted muscles, this effects-laden lump of cinematic coal is as nonsensical and ill-conceived as it is boring.
An animated corpse of a film about a reanimated one.
There are a lot of people local and abroad responsible for this dismal film.
The last thing this film wants to do is make a believable world.
Ay-yi-yi, Frankenstein.
Aaron Eckhart tries his best but he can't breathe life into this monster of a movie.
I, Frankenstein doesn't have much of a brain and is completely missing a funny bone.
I, Frankenstein looks suspiciously like it was conceived more as a ready-made franchise property than as a strong individual story.
