The sense of detachment that is a signature of Sofia Coppola's work -- the coolly distant, stylishly dreamlike way she regards her characters -- works to her detriment in The Bling Ring.
All the characters are shallow and one-dimensional and, while one can argue that this is the point, it doesn't make for 90 minutes of engaging cinema.
However, the bigger issue at play here is the lack of subtlety, a concept seemingly not invented at the time Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this movie.
Maybe you could stretch some deeper meaning out of it, surmising that Coppola wanted to make as vapid and empty a movie as her subjects and their inspiration. That's great for a Film & Society term paper, but it doesn't exactly make for a riveting movie.
Lively, engaging, and a little too obvious
Coppola's latest effort is the most superficial film I've seen since "Spring Breakers" earlier this year. There's so little here in the way of substance that it becomes quite an amazing feat that she was able to stretch it out into a 90-minute feature.
"While many loved Coppola's earliest pics, no one was happy with Marie Antoinette and many loathed Somewhere, and this based-on-fact latest again opts for a cheesy study of fame with characters who almost dare you to like them."
The Bling Ring suggests Coppola still has the nose for a good story, but not the depth to sufficiently explore it.
Top marks to the cast who deliver these characters exactly as intended: shallow, stupid, reckless, irresponsible, self centred and extremely irritating. I wanted to smack them all as they snorted the stolen cocaine
A typically underwhelming effort from Sofia Coppola...
