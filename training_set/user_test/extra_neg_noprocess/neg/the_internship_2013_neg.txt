You don't need a heart to like this movie. You need an MBA.
Similar to Eddie Murphy's hard right turn from daring and profane comedy to family-friendly romps, Vaughn and Wilson have gone all soft and gooey here.
It's a testament to the duo's jazzy comic chemistry that they wring some laughs from this dated, frankly sinister premise.
There are plenty of films out there competing for your money ... 'The Internship' doesn't even deserve a part-time gig ...
One of those movies that milks its stars' inherent charisma for as long as it can, but it does so mainly because it has little else.
It isn't really a movie about friendship or new beginnings - it's a movie about selling Google.
'The Internship' isn't as funny or exuberant as 'Wedding Crashers' and the plot is formulaic, but as lightweight entertainment goes it's . . . well, light and entertaining.
