It (almost literally) runs off the rails with a series of twists that ultimately invite more laughs than tension.
While Last Passenger is in the same vein as films such as Unstoppable, Speed, Joy Ride, and Premium Rush, it lacks a proper resolution and its empty thrills don't make up for its inadequate amount of substance.
A runaway-train action thriller that coasts along serviceably for a bit before entering Boredom Station, this British-produced rip-off of Speed lacks compelling characterizations.
