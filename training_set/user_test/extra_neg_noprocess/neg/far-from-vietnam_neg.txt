A broken film doesn't really make the best statement about anything. Or utter a cry.
None of the French talent involved seemed to recall that the Vietnam conflict had its roots in the French military occupation of Indochina. Obviously, there was more than a little amnesia on the road from Dien Bien Phu to the Cannes screening rooms.
Most problematic is the way in which the Vietnamese are romanticized, as if they had not fought for their livelihoods and land, visceral and specific, but for ideals alone.
