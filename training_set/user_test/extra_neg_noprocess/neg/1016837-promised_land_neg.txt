Far too awkward and contrived a drama to change many hearts and minds.
The film never makes a convincing argument against fracking, probably because it's too busy being cloying.
'You can't make natural gas from shale without fracking' doesn't quite have the same ring to it as 'You can't start a fire without a spark'.
The pro-environment message here is more effective because of the film's subtlety, a casting twist featuring the likeable Matt Damon, and a script that doesn't insult its audience.
There are some good scenes early on, and the conflict at the centre is real. But it's sentimental, Capraesque fare ...
underwhelming at best
A gentle rather than dramatic film that, once the central argument is laid out, lacks real flair.
Van Sant is no Frank Capra, so why is he trying so hard to be?
Not confident or bolshy enough about the subject, too aware of eco versus economic pros and cons ...
The film means well, it just doesn't stir the soul.
Feels more Hollywoodland than 'Promised Land'.
