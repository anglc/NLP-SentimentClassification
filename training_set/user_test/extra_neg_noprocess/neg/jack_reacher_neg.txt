Jack Reacher already feels as if it belongs to another era.
A clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie that offers little more than every other clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie.
A workmanlike action thriller, competent but never particularly thrilling.
Jack Reacher is an absurdly self-confident, sociopathically laser-focused detective-bot. That is to say, he's a hero that only Tom Cruise could love.
Cruise does his best to keep a straight face and make himself halfway believable as a brainy roughhouser - think of a less intense Jason Bourne - but ridiculous plotting undermines his efforts.
Jack Reacher revolves around wild impossibilities and baffling motivations, and the conclusion is a whopper that outdoes everything I've discussed above.
Another macho loner fights for justice
It's easy to like the idea of a Jack Reacher movie; it takes a little more effort to like the one writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (who penned 'The Usual Suspect's) has made.
Reacher is a fascinating character, to be sure, both a virtuous crusader for justice and a cold-blooded killer. Here's hoping that any future big-screen installments might develop those conflicted sides into something with a darker edge.
An often outlandish, overly talky crime-procedural drama that seems like a vanity project its marquee star must have wanted to do with his director buddy while waiting for their next "Mission Impossible" collaboration.
