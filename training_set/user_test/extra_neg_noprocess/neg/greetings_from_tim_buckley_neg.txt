Algrant's desire to reunite father and son through music is admirable, but "Greetings from Tim Buckley" is too meandering and ethereal to have any lasting impact.
The movie struggles to find its footing, lacking the dramatic tension to make it of much interest beyond the fan base of the supremely talented, tragically fated Buckleys.
Music-filled drama amounts to several promises unfulfilled except for some solid performances and a terrific soundtrack of Buckley songs, both actual and skillfully recreated.
There is no doubt that Greetings From Tim Buckley is respectable...But the film never quite connects father and son as each sharing the common bond of extraordinary talent or even similar personal woes.
