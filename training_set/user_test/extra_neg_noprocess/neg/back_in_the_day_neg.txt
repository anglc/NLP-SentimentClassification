[A] stale, schmaltzy and testosterone-drenched comedy.
There are a lot of odious movies yet to come in 2014, no doubt, but they'll have to work to beat "Back in the Day" for awfulness.
Cloying and smug when it's not being unfunny and crass, the high school reunion comedy "Back in the Day" hits lows with a frequency that suggests a world-class sharp shooter or free-throw king.
Good for a couple of fart jokes and otherwise utterly forgettable.
There aren't many laughs along the way (unless you count fart jokes), nor is there any nostalgic value.
