A brittle, pompous drama about artists and the price they pay for inspiration.
"The Time Being'' looks sharp, but it's about as dramatically satisfying as watching paint dry.
An exhaustingly pretentious heave of artistic self-involvement, "The Time Being" takes an exceptionally handsome journey to nowhere at all.
While the underdeveloped script - co-written by Richard Gladstein - never earns its sense of self-importance, the visuals are evocative enough to draw us further into the movie's ultimately unsatisfying mysteries.
Not to be glib, but sitting through the art-centric chamber piece "The Time Being" is truly like watching paint dry.
Snail paced, insufferably portentous, and virtually devoid of notable incident ...
Despite some powerful imagery, the film provides only minimal insight into the artistic process, and its characters aren't compelling enough to pick up the slack.
Langella is solid as always, but his haunted, bitter character is pretty two-dimensional, and having to share all his scenes with Bentley doesn't allow for much interplay.
A more apt title might have been Wes Bentley Stares at Stuff.
Director Nemad Cicin-Sain and co-writer Richard N. Gladstein are both guilty of serving up a totally empty, tonally confused meditation on the creative process.
