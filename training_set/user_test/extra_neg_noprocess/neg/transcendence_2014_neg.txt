The movie is rhythmless, shapeless, and, with the exception of a few shots, cheesy-looking.
Remember when paycheck-hungry actors were accused of phoning in a performance? Johnny Depp spins that for millennials in Transcendence by Skpying in his performance.
When it's all over, you will turn on your iPhone and ask Siri to find you a good restaurant for a bite to eat near the theater. And you will have learned nothing.
"Transcendence" is a moronic stew of competing impulses - bad science meets bad sociology meets bad theology ...
One of those "control technology or it will control you" sermons that nonetheless enlists the usual heap of technically advanced special effects.
Transcendence doesn't induce paranoia, wonder, or suspense. It's the most incurious film you could make about something as simultaneously preposterous and promising as Johnny Depp the Internet.
Pfister seems afraid to recognize the humor inherent in a story that requires Johnny Depp to become a grim sort of Max Headroom...
It is not only a bad film, it is a rather boring film.
Just think of junk like "Lawnmower Man," and "The Mangler 2," and you pretty much sum up what director Wally Pfister tries to pass off as a sophisticated techno-thriller.
Ambitious, but poorly realized, "Transcendence" is a movie with forward-thinking ideas that fails to gel as a narrative.
While Transcendence starts out with a fascinating premise, it loses its way pretty quickly by turning into a sappy and ultimately silly film that isn't able to capitalize on the lofty ideas contained within.
