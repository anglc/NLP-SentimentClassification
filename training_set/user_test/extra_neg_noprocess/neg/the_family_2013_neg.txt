A movie with a PG brain and a NC-17 body count, unsuitable for audiences of any age.
An all-star cast fails to rise above bloody japes and heavy-handed humor in this tale of a renegade Mob family hiding in a small French town.
A black comedy that doesn't begin to jell but has a sweetheart of a cast and the odd diverting moment.
The casting of Robert De Niro as an ex-Mafioso hiding in witness protection is witty in only the silliest, most superficial way. It's a joke with its own tinny, built-in laugh track.
The Family is a film at once strange and intriguing. It can't seem to settle on a tone.
De Niro's deadpan humour suits a garden burial perfectly, but we just don't see enough of how we really want him to be.
Features a contender for worst subplot of the year.
A terrible waste of many wonderful talents in front of and behind the camera.
Could've been an inoffensive enough 90 minute feature, but the film insists on garbling the narrative with useless subplots that...bloat the movie beyond the breaking point.
American family, presumed obnoxious by French villagers, deals with problems by being obnoxiously, smugly violent. The daughter, when not beating people up, is a moist-eyed virgin eroticized by the camera, all her romantic aspirations cringingly mawkish.
As lifeless and dull as any of the characters whacked during this dramedy's bloated running time.
Unfortunately, The Family suffers from an extreme case of advanced tonal disorder.
Every time Luc Besson uses a bullet in a body as a punchline, a real joke somewhere out in the wild dies.
It's throwaway stuff, packed with corny gags about rich French cooking and annoying Gallic manners, in which light relief is offered by the sight of our hero torturing a plumber; think The Whole Nine Yards with cheese.
Clearly, De Niro is happy to cannibalise his glorious past, but for those of us who love him, it's like sucking on old bones.
Their fish-out-of-water antics leave a nasty taste in the mouth rather than a smile on the face.
Besson has made a career out of a willingness to experiment but The Family's tonal variations jar.
It's horribly violent, the family are appalling, it's never believable and far too long.
The collateral damage involving innocent bystanders is staggering. Just mind you don't get caught in the crossfire.
There was a time when De Niro seemed so ungraspable, so brilliant, it was as if he had some secret access to acting that nobody else could fully understand. Maybe in the end we asked too much of him.
A disgraced mob family are sent on a Euro vacation in this weak wiseguy satire with Robert De Niro.
An unimaginative and humourless dark comedy from French director Luc Besson, starring Robert De Niro who appears to be phoning his lines in.
Besson strikes a jarring tone between crime and comedy; a soundtrack of irritatingly 'wacky' accordion music prescribes a comic mood rarely met by laughter.
It makes you want to revisit Goodfellas, though.
