Everything about Are You Here feels like a bottom-drawer script idea that was put together too casually and carelessly.
Are You Here lacks more than just the question mark that should go on its title. It lacks a point-of-view that makes sense, that feels central.
"Are You Here" doesn't feel all there.
[An] endearing muddle, which flails in search of an identity.
The movie is the cinematic equivalent of dead air.
The film struggles to find a consistent tone between its attempts at broad stoner comedy, fractured family quirks and a more serious examination of mental illness.
In the end, Are You Here isn't quite funny enough to be a comedy, nor does it take itself seriously enough to be a drama. I would say that it's a dramedy, but the tone is so erratic that it doesn't really fit in that category either.
What does surprise is that the talented ensemble has to cajole this ungainly movie along even as it changes its mind about whether it wants to be a romantic comedy, a lighthearted bromance.
Proof that genius doesn't always successfully translate from one medium to another.
Surely the characters on Mad Men aren't as one-note as these otherwise a petition should be started to have Weiner's Emmys forcibly removed.
Flawed friendship dramedy has plenty of drugs, some sex.
This is one of those semi-serious projects comedians occasionally step into, wanting to stretch and winding up straining.
A comedy with no laughs. A drama disconnected from any known reality.
Many a critic has said that there's nothing worse than an unfunny comedy...and Are You Here proves that point over and over again.
Have Wilson, Galifianakis and Poehler ever been better? Gosh, I certainly hope so.
Are You Here is a notable misfire.
