If Moors and Porto were aiming for gun-debate relevance, they've failed; "Blue Caprice" has nothing to say about a society plagued by violence, nor does it focus on mental illness as a probable cause.

Thoughtful performances and grim visual elegance aren't enough to save this portrait of abuse and control twisted into banal evil from becoming too banal to have much bite.
