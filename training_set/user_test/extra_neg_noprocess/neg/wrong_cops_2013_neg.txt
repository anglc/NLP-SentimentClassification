No doubt a labor of love, the result is just plain laborious for the audience.
Pitched somewhere between a DIY alt-humor video and a knockabout comedy, this meandering lark about a corrupt, spiteful and hopelessly distracted police force in a decriminalized, sun-scorched city never quite finds the funny bone.
A tedious exercise in self-consciously hip lowbrow comedy.
It's tonally weird and totally forgettable.
Dumb is a word you use as a kid, but it's the only way to describe Quentin Dupieux's latest, WRONG COPS.
