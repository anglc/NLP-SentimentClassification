Hill's eye for back alley scuzz is as strong as ever, but the story, adapted from a French graphic novel by Alexis Nolent, is so die-cut it gives neither him nor Stallone anything to work with.
It's a series of fight scenes that build to a climax that is surprisingly unsatisfying in the way it ultimately plays out.
Sylvester Stallone shoots people in the face. That's it for subtext in this formula action swill. Why do I sound like I should expect more. Because the credits list the director as Walter Hill.
Stallone can still be entertaining, but here he's got no character to play, nothing fun to say, and the craziest hair/hairpiece/scalp growth this side of John Travolta.
It says "revenge never gets old." Yeah, but Sylvester Stallone did. Yikes.
A big, dumb action film that charges forward believing Stallone is charismatic enough to sell even bad writing. He's not.
As unsubtle as its title, this action film is repetitive and packed with silly cliches that should be put to sleep.
Nothing to write home about, but with some decent fight sequences, good stunts, and amusing banter between Stallone and Kang. No need to rush out to the cineplex, although worthwhile to catch on-demand later this year.
The roar dies into a hollow echo, the growl gets gutturally one-note and the grit becomes B-movie background. Has too scuzzy a heart to pump out a deep throb of action. Peel this one back and you get more pit than pulp.
At its ridiculous best Bullet reminds us why we liked Stallone in the first place. But time has moved on, for him and for us and there's a point where looking back this way stops being entertaining and starts to become sad.
What's it about? Some bad guys. And some other bad guys. And some badder guys. And bullets to the head, as though through repetition of the title in action we're meant to finally understand the platonic ideal of how to murder a person with a gun.
A barely passable, if unmemorable, bit of action-heavy entertainment -- as long as you don't think too hard about the script's eye-rollingly contrived setup.
Look, Stallone has a perky daughter. Will she end up tied to a chair in a disused refinery (or something)? You know it.
... a star vehicle for Stallone first and foremost, giving him a potentially intriguing antihero character surrounded by a story that shoots blanks.
An okay action movie but sadly Stallone has entered into the "who cares" category.
