The movie's principal intention is to make you laugh at a loser, and revel in scenes from which polite people would instinctively turn away.
It's obnoxious when it means to be comic, and excruciating when it wants to be moving.
It's a rambling, pointless and labored attempt to cash in on Ms. McCarthy's fan base without respect for any audience with a collective IQ of 10. And it's about as funny as a liver transplant.
McCarthy's performance of unself-conscious uncouthness celebrates the freedom to be undignified. And, still, it's being misused.
Tammy is an object lesson in the art of directing, which is all it would have taken to turn this near-miss into an instant classic. Though that may be true of most mediocre movies.
A lot of good actors are wasted in this film in bit roles, including Allison Janney, Sandra Oh, and Dan Aykroyd. The ones with bigger roles, like Mark Duplass and Kathy Bates, are wasted, too.
The character's jagged edges convey only McCarthy's star-vehicle opportunism.
[Star] McCarthy has so much more talent than what this unwatchable nonsense displays.
Perpetually feels a few good jokes away from being really funny.
When Melissa McCarthy tries cracking wise in front of the camera in what are obviously attempts at improvisation, man, those moments feel like they go on forever. And there's way too many of them. She strives for punchlines that never eventuate.
After Identity Thief (co-starring Jason Bateman) and The Heat (Sandra Bullock), Tammy marks the third film in a row to have McCarthy annoy, mistreat and then belatedly make amends with a mismatched sidekick.
The filmmakers never quite find the balance between real-life experience and freewheeling nonsense that drives the best comic road movies.
The film is a mild imitation of a traditional slapstick comedy, and there's nothing here but a few laughs and an unsatisfying ending.
A disaster as a comedy from the first frame to the last, the film is also smotheringly cloying, heaping more unearned sentimentality, false pathos and super-saccherinated schmaltz onto its "odd couple" than any adult should ever have to endure.
Contender for worst film of the year, Tammy is painful. If you are looking for a good laugh, a well-written script, engaging characters, quirky relationships, a story with heart and having a whale of a time, this Melissa McCarthy comedy is not it
Too often, at least during its first half, Tammy feels like a case of been there, done something similar but not quite as over-the-top as that.
"Tammy" is a movie that is painful, pathetic, and more willing to engage in a joke about getting fingered by Boz Scaggs than anything even remotely introspective.
Falls into that narrow crevice between cringe comedy and working-class drama. Then, deep underground, long out of the range of humour, it flails where no one can hear it, drawing scenes out into shapeless, squalid things.
The screenplay contains some big laughs scattered between a series of labored and uninspired gags that don't play to the strengths of its stars.
"Tammy" is tedious and dull, no matter how hard McCarthy tries to liven it up
