Reviewers were forbidden from posting a word about this sequel until opening day, lest we give away the shocking secret that it's a carbon copy of its predecessor.
There are a handful of ways in which A Dame to Kill For actually improves on the first movie. Alas, none are enough to prevent it from being a substantial disappointment.
Miller's original comic-book frames serve narrative functions, but these movies are all grabby graphics, devoid of compelling style.
You don't expect to be exhausted by reams of soul-sick narration and artful chiaroscuro compositions, but that's what happens.
I can't actually be sure that anything happened.
The fact that the performances are stronger this time doesn't compensate for what is just a hundred minutes of droning nonsense.
Unfortunately, the long-awaited sequel Sin City: A Dame to Kill doesn't prove to be worth the wait. Whereas the first film was kitschy, ambitious schlock, its sequel is a monotonous, shallow, parody of its predecessor.
The narration feels overdone and the stories aren't as captivating.
Creative, lurid, immature, and pointless
After the near-brilliance Robert Rodriguez achieved with 2005's Sin City comes the sequel that has been promised for so long it crossed that line where people just stopped caring. And with good reason.
Familiar actors come and bloodily go, generally failing to make sense of reductive roles.
There's a bleak beauty to all of this, but also there's a reliance on stereotypes, male and female, that, while they come directly from the source material, are starting to become irritating.
Sin City 2 isn't a particularly inferior film to its predecessor. It's just that, after all this time, the novelty is no longer there.
Becomes full-on parody without even necessarily recognizing it.
Coalesce[s] into a sort of indistinguishable mushiness in Rodriguez and Miller's flabby directorial hands.
If Sin City was a hard-on of sex and violence told in an eye popping world of gritty nourish delights, than Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is its impotent follow up.
No snappy lines; melodrama and vicious violence prevail. Less a pastiche of noir than a hyper-sado-macho parody. There's a scuzzy sense of pointlessness throughout as this noir caricature-slicked franchise goes through its animotions.
The movie is a more joyless affair than all this suggests. Had you never seen a film noir, nor read any Raymond Chandler or Mickey Spillane, you would not guess from watching this picture that the genre was known for whiskey-dry wit.
