Ethan and Sophie are never more than playthings of the premise; Moss and Duplass are the sole sources of nuance and vitality, and they seem unduly hemmed in by the movie's unimaginative confines.
It's proof positive of how really good Moss and Duplass are here once you realise that in terms of technique that haven't been asked much more than to re-act deadpan and endure ever so long pauses no matter how stupid it all gets.
