Frankenstein's Army is a ludicrous World War II horror flick bogged down by its found-footage gimmick, which is compromised and contradicted so often that it becomes a distraction.
Just feels like great potential was wasted on a movie interested in gore and shock value over atmosphere and genuine terror.
We never care about any of the soldiers. What we do care about are the monsters, and with good reason: They're pips.
At every turn, Frankenstein's Army exhibits a preference for jolt scares and gore over actual suspense, which never materializes, thanks to a general indifference to plot and minimal interest in character
The found-footage gimmick mostly comes off as window dressing for what turns out to be yet another mad-scientist-run-amok romp.
Like the monster evoked by the film's title, everything feels tacked together.
