It's a film whose plea to the audience resembles Jobs' appeal to the crowd in that iPod-unveiling scene: "Believe this is important and exciting," it asks, "because I say so."
The irony is that a man who treasured innovation and sleek, stylish design should be the subject of a film that's so bland and bloated.
Other than people who are mildly curious about the guy who put the smartphone in their pocket and the tablet computer in their knapsack, I'm not sure who "Jobs" was made for.
Jobs is the equivalent of a feature-length slow clap.
A missed opportunity.
A noble but unworthy effort that will likely disappoint viewers looking for a thoughtful look into the technological genius.
Matt Whiteley's clumsy script attempts to sync Jobs' personal story with the corporate history of his brand but as any affirmed Android/PC users will gladly tell you, syncing with Apple can be problematic at the best of times.
This movie would be exponentially better if it were called Twenty-Something Jobs or Jobs, Woz And The First 2 Apples.
While it may be of interest to some, it's not going to provide any new perspective for those already familiar with Jobs' life.
One can see Kutcher acting, valiantly trying oh-so-hard as his every answer to any requirement for emotional intensity unilaterally comes off as merely shrilly raising the volume of his voice.
It admittedly feels like something of a missed opportunity, with director, Joshua Michael Stern, often more concerned with checking off bullet points than digging into the complexities of its leading man.
It reminds me of a similar film, 'The Social Network,' which is the better movie, but these two films tell essentially the same story.
Never really digs deep enough into the brilliant and often enigmatic title character. Begs for a documentary treatment.
You could call this a crowd-pleasing Hollywood ending. You could also call it genocide.
jOBS demonstrates the difference between a great impression and an inspired performance.
Many of the creative details are embellished or reduced to montages in favor of a series of inspirational speeches.
Forget by the numbers, this biopic is practically binary in its formulaic creation.
Jobs feels more like a movie about Apple than the man who founded it.
Good performance by Kutcher as Steve Jobs but the movie glosses over his life.
