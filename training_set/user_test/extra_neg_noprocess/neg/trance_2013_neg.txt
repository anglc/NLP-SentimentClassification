I came away wondering whether the headache I left the theater with was such a bad -- or even unintentional -- thing after all.
The plot of Trance is purposely convoluted - you're supposed to get more and more confused as the story unfolds, not always sure if what you're watching is a dream.
In the first half I was definitely invested in what was unfolding, but couldn't believe by the end that director Boyle could deliver something so ham fisted and clunky.
The muddled mental states of the characters (and that of the audience) are mirrored by the film's visual style, which oscillates between languorous dreamscapes and frenetic action sequences.
An occasionally frustrating and far-fetched psychological thriller with enough deceptive plot switchbacks and visual tricks for three movies.
At least the film looks great, but without much of a spark, 'Trance' can only make you sleepy - very sleepy.
