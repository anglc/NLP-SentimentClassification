This project ... has clearly diverted too much of its small budget toward special effects.
It's hard to see why IFC Films would attach themselves to this ho-hum scarefest.
While the cast and crew's competence well exceed what anyone would expect from this breed of B movies, they cannot compensate for the flawed internal logic in the screenplay.
Some of the voluminous attention paid to details ... should have been spent on good old-fashioned shivers.
Character motivation, cleverness and intelligence don't factor into Almost Human, a gory genre homage that could have been an underground terror treat, instead of a "Cult Movies' Greatest Hits."
While Almost Human pays homage to some truly great horror and sci-fi films of the past, it fails to really personify its own identity and it crumbles under the weight of paying too much homage without building its own foundation.
Writer-director Joe Begos and [...] editor/star Josh Ethier, clearly adore 1980s horror [...] Their first no-budget feature [is] a deliberate throwback to the era's slapdash passion, ignoring every direction the genre has taken in the decades since.
Existing as some sort of low-rent Eli Roth imitation that miraculously leaves us wishing we were watching one of Roth's films instead.
The degree to which Almost Human ultimately peters out is rather distressing (to put it mildly)...
