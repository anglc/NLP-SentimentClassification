Matches narrative incoherence with one of the most over-the-top portentous scores in horror-cinema history.
A standard-issue creepshow, undermined by script holes and a meager budget that brings distinctly subpar effects.
The film's sense of conviction and psychological nuance never rises above that of the "I Learned It from Watching You" anti-drug PSA.
What the production aims to pull off with the picture in the early going isn't where the movie ends up, torching a promising premise on tiresome storytelling and a mangled tonal balance.
A film of two halves - one dull, the other exciting and funny.
