A quaint labor of love blinkered by fidelity to an outdated text.
It's easy to glean why this unapologetically niche film nearly died on the vine.
Flavorless ordinariness.
Explores some interesting issues but saddled with many low-budget constraints that take away its level of theatrical experience that a film like this should have.
A too-literal adaptation of Philip K. Dick's paranoid science fiction fantasy about government conspiracies, hidden realities, and conversations with parallel universes lacks the atmosphere and human feeling it demands to work on any level.
Perhaps for Dick purists, this movie will settle in without disruption, but it certainly doesn't welcome outsiders, preferring tattered credibility to needed accessibility.
A very talky Philip K. Dick adaptation that is all exposition, explanation and political prophecy, with zero empathy or warmth
