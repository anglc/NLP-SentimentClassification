A thriller that might as well have been released in 1996, when everybody and their brother and their sister and their cousin twice-removed was trying to be Quentin Tarantino ...
The film's subtle visual allure is all but stamped out by the impression that the director tries too hard to be an idiosyncratic auteur in the vein of Quentin Tarantino.
Violet and Daisy are just violent and crazy - which is, ultimately, the real problem. And why we should care about them remains the one mystery no one here can quite unravel.
A rather dull affair.
We don't feel the weight and menace of death, nor the volatile emotions of youth, and have nothing to respond to beyond the spectacle of girls with guns.
This self-consciously quirky comedy-thriller... swings unevenly between passages of soul searching and bouts of cartoony violence in the Tarantino mould.
Alexis Bledel and Saoirse Ronan are way too good for material as obnoxious as this.
A lot of acting talent is squandered in Violet & Daisy, a sort of postmodern coming-of-age story about two teenage girls who kill people for a living, then play patty-cake as they plan their next hit.
Subverting audience expectations of an over the top "teenage girl killer" movie with a character study could have been great, but the character study in question feels paper thin.
Neither as writer nor as director is Fletcher able to sustain his conceit.
While the concept has potential, it becomes an exercise in shallow gimmickry that never captures the right tone to generate either laughs or suspense.
A movie can stick with genre basics if it has fun doing so, but Violet & Daisy lacks the freewheeling spirit of great B movies.
You can almost see the moment when the super-talented Saoirse Ronan checks out in terms of character and I think James Gandolfini gave up before the end of rehearsal. I just felt bad for Alexis Bledel.
Clever for a little while, but turns irritating halfway through.
It wants to be "Clueless" meets Gregg Araki, but it has far less on its mind than the former teen classic and not nearly enough provocative material to match the latter indie director's sensibilities.
