A perfectly realized period piece, so gorgeously shot it looks almost painterly but it's so god-awful grim and...so tightly focused on such a disagreeable character that I greeted its fade out as the equivalent of the end of a migraine headache.
This blackly comic character study set in the hotbed of New York's early-60s folk scene fails because there's zero character development.
