There's nothing less interesting in an animated feature than slow pans over blinking eyes, and, boy, does Rise of the Technovore have a lot of those.
Animated Iron Man adventure is convoluted and violent.
A scattered, dull adventure that seems surprisingly dated for a character who's always on the cutting edge of technology.
