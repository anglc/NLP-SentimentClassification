Will do little to crystallize the convoluted picture of how the Catskills had a lasting impact on comedy.
Shapeless and generic.
The film is slight at 77 minutes, and not all that funny.
It answers that age-old question: What happens when a can't-miss subject gets missed?
One minute it's about the comedians, the next it's about the Catskills guest experience, the next about the Jewish immigrant experience and Jewish theatre, and the next about indefatigable Jewish humor itself.
Where's the joy? Where's the dramatic conflict? Where's the beef? Uh, brisket?
With its cheap Television production values, Karaoke quality soundtrack, and poorly focused narrative, these legendary comedians definitely deserve something better than this.
Oy gevalt!What a disappoinment!
