What's missing from Blended? Two key ingredients: it doesn't touch the heart and it doesn't tickle the funny bone (at least not often enough).
The romance is sweet and even effervescent, the comedy is homespun and sentimental, but it's packaged with such a repellent batch of stereotypes and prejudices that it's unpalatable even to contemplate.
In the world of this sitcom love story, men are from Mars and women should be from a defiled menstrual tent far enough away that Adam Sandler won't have to hear them talk about tampons.
Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore star in Blended, their third pairing, and, while the chemistry may be good, the movie isn't.
Comedians often draw on childhood influences, and Adam Sandler and his team do it in the worst possible way in Blended.. [which] is like a Bizarro version of The Brady Bunch.
Sandler would piss out of the screen if he thought he could get a laugh. This is not his worst film, but it's his most offensive.
Hasn't Africa suffered enough?
I wish "Blended" were more a family ensemble dramedy and not a Barrymore and Sandler vehicle that rips off of "Yours, Mine and Ours."
Adam Sandler fans who are members of blended families may love it the most. All others will wish Blended had the courage to include more identifiable human moments and fewer screwing rhinos.
Blessedly written by someone who's not Sandler--and it's almost passable, even palatable ... until the movie throws in vagina-size jokes. And passes off tomboys as weird non-men. And goes to "Africa."
Typical Sandler contrived comedy, with more heart and the likeable Drew Barrymore to help keep the African safari-themed absurdity and crudity to tolerant levels.
The uninspired screenplay is content to recycle the same jokes over and over, with gradually diminished returns.
Blended is awful. It's the kind of awful film where it's hard to resist the temptation to just list all the awful things that happen in it and pass that off as a review.
DREW Barrymore tends to bring out the best in Adam Sandler - so much so that their re-teaming almost saves Blended.
Bland on the one hand, tacky on the other, Blended lives up to its name in more ways than one.
It has become something of a tradition to dismiss the latest Adam Sandler movie outright or, if one is feeling particularly generous, damn it with faint praise. Blended is no exception to this strategy.
Blended? Blanded more like.
Blended is pure pablum, loosely masquerading as a "romantic comedy," though its sorely lacking in both those areas.
Even with its inane script and limp direction, this film is watchable simply because Drew Barrymore is present to humanise Adam Sandler.
You get a sense of where it's headed as the first scene opens to the sound of a toilet flushing and the sight of Drew Barrymore exiting a public restroom stall.
Adam Sandler's latest paid vacation (with back-end points) is Blended, a comedy with fewer surprises than a Hooters menu.
Adam Sandler's astonishing run of bottom-of-the-barrel comedies continues with Blended...
'Blended' is actually one of the 'better' Sandler films, which is to say it's sometimes almost half-tolerable.
If you're looking for an Adam Sandler date-night movie, well, Blended is an Adam Sandler date-night movie. It's got all the lowbrow humor and predictability you crave.
