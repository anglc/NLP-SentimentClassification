Lizzy Caplan and Alison Brie lend the lightweight rom-com "Save the Date" more than its fair share of watchability. But the film is never truly interesting.
While Caplan works well in theory as an antiromantic-comedy heroine, director and co-screenwriter Michael Mohan just doesn't give her enough to do.
[It] may sound like Sitcomland, but Mr. Mohan's sensibility - visually, comically, in terms of character - is more naturalistic, more Sundance. It's just not particularly sharp.
A merely adequate addition to the raft of romantic comedies for those pushing 30 without adult lives to call their own.
Save the Date is romantic comedy with aspirations to do something new. That's admirable but it isn't enough.
Slumbers through routine conflicts, often in the dullest manner imaginable, refusing the lure of a snappy pace to wallow in poor communication contests that grow intolerable.
There's a finely-tuned sense of how difficult it can be to live life on your own terms, but the film so resolutely adheres to indie conventions it's hard to take seriously.
What's worst about the film is how it appropriates its main character's noncommittal selfishness to support its own quaint, anti-establishment themes.
'Save the Date' traffics in the most banal situations and whiny characters imaginable.
