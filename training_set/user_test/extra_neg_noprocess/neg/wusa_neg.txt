It's too bad that the execution of this Paul Newman starring film is so poor for it raises some interesting social and political issues
...serves as a nostalgia-inducing oddity, a kind of scrapbook of American sensibility at the end of the 1960s, a time when there really were people ... who believed we were on the brink of revolution
... the film hammers home its politics with blunt force yet leaves the conspiracy drama vague, more symbolic gesture of outrage than convincing plot.
