This lazy and uninspired horror sequel is a movie worthy of quarantine.
It's pandemic time!
Better actors would have helped.
Director Kaare Andrews' and screenwriter Jake Wade Wall's interminable set-up is hardly worth the uninspired rollout of the second half's carnage follies ...
Cabin Fever: Patient Zero ditches the nasty allegory of Eli Roth's original and Ti West's studio-butchered first sequel for far duller, standard-issue conventions.
"Cabin Fever: Patient Zero" lacks the personality and humor of Eli Roth's debut feature, but it delivers in droves on the grisly brand of payoffs for which his original film is known.
While there are some nicely gory moments, the film feels rather uninspired ...
Not a great film and it isn't supposed to be, but Cabin Fever 3: Patient Zero more or less does its job of delivering equal parts laughter and fright.
Yes, horror fans, this is one of those movies in which we praise the makeup instead of the plotting, characters, or scares.
It's entertaining enough if you're a fan of rotting-girl catfights...and evil conspiracies, but there's no there there and little reason to stick it out to the predictably miserable end except so you can say you did.
[Kaare Andrews and Jake Wade Wall]'s attempt isn't scary enough for homage or funny enough for satire. They muster just enough baseline, journeyman competence to be boring.
This is less a movie than a dutiful renewal of a recognizable title's licensing rights.
The best thing I can say about Cabin Fever: Patient Zero is that it works for people who love blood and gore.
May be enough for horror buffs looking for a quick, disposable fix of Fangoria-style mayhem, but lacks the substance to match its unrepentantly bloody style.
The best thing I can say about "Patient Zero" is: while it's awful, it's at least not unwatchable like "Cabin Fever" and its sequel.
