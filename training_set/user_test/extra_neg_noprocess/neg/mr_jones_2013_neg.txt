A nature-meets-nightmare tale that unfortunately gets lost in its own thicket of tricks.
There's a shred of an interesting idea in Mr. Jones, but the film is far too unfocused, sloppy, and downright dull to leave any kind of impact.
No matter how creative its frames, Mr. Jones is [...] just an unimpressive stack of sticks and skulls.
That it half succeeds, in spite of its cloying self-seriousness, means that it's at best a convincing copycat of a definitive expression of ego and influence in art.
In attempting to experiment with horror tropes and the found-footage format, director Karl Mueller tries too hard and walks away with a muddled, drastically uneven hodgepodge.
You can't really dip into dream logic if you have nary a single eye-popping visual, and in doing so, Mueller completely wastes a unique, potentially durable concept.
