[Blu-ray Review] This Blu-ray disc of "Hammer of the Gods" looks aesthetically beautiful, brought to life in all its moody, fog-drenched glory. My only wish is that the film itself was better.
If it's gratuitous Saxon violence you're after then you've come to the right place.
A nasty, brutal and relatively short entertainment, aimed at middle-of-the-woad Conanists.
Hammer of the Gods avoids any real risks and lacks in distinct innovation.
So Hammer of the Gods is that most unexpected and unlikely of films, a Viking Apocalypse Then - but while it is an enjoyable enough romp, trying to out-hammer the impact of Coppola's masterpiece is as foolhardy as challenging the gods themselves.
Dumb and dreary but ultimately hard to hate.
This is what happens when your Lord of the Rings cosplay gets overrun by Method stuntmen.
Barely one step above a middling Game of Thrones fan-film, albeit executed with little of the passion that this would imply.
Imagine TV's The Vikings with a twist and you won't be disappointed, but the biggest heroics on show here are in the budget-stretching department.
There's an abundance of hand-to-hand medieval combat violence but not much else in this absurdly macho action saga.
Pointlessly graphic and absolutely ridiculous, Hammer of the Gods is a poorly attended LARP event crossed with basic cable fantasy filmmaking standards.
Hammer of the Gods steals freely from a number of modern action films, but the fact that it is so misguided and fares so poorly is another thing entirely.
An unbearably stupid exercise in gore that deserves to die the same cruel, soulless death that nearly every character does at some point in the film.
