The music rocks, but little else does, in Randall Miller's sitcom snapshot of New York's iconic punk incubator.
"CBGB" ain't no party, it ain't no disco, it ain't no foolin' around.
If you really want to remember those times? Get out "Horses." Or "Talking Heads: 77." Or "Blank Generation." Preferably on vinyl, with all the pops and scratches. And play them. Loud.
I would swear on a stack of Dead Boys T-shirts and a first pressing of Richard Hell and the Voidoids' "Blank Generation" that it could not possibly have been like that: so silly, so trivial, so boring.
In place of punk's howling rage, you get gross-out jokes that include at least a half-dozen close-ups of the poop from Kristal's bowel-challenged dog.
You figure a movie that features the Ramones and Blondie would be so extraordinary and energetic, but "CBGB" makes them seem so mundane and unimportant.
Plays like it was written and directed by people who have never listened to or heard of punk rock in their lives
Under Rickman's pained gaze you wonder what he saw in the music, although when you hear it... it does take you back. There's something there, but CBGB isn't it.
It's '24 Hour Party People' without the wit and definitely without the love of the music it pretends to lionize.
Ultimately, CBGB tries to be too cute of a film about a great, gritty topic, but for those seeking an innocent trip through a pivotal time in rock, it's better than a kick in the head.
By no stretch of the imagination is CBGB a well-made movie. [But] since the lightweight plot and great music make this less annoying than Rock of Ages, fans of the era may find something to enjoy.
The film has energy to spare, but the comic-book visual style is heavy-handed and the film merely skims the surface of the club's influence on the pop-culture landscape.
A rushed, chaotic and almost incoherent recap of the backstory behind the Lower East Side's iconic (and now defunct) punk music club.
The magnitude of what went on at 315 Bowery is largely missing, though it's hard not to be at least a little bit stirred by the covers.
Warm gloss of nostalgia over the rise of the punk music scene in gritty 1970's downtown New York. The spirit of musical and visual energy outweighs fanciful superficiality.
It takes a lot of effort to take the underdog stomping grounds of New York's top punk acts and turn them into the Central Perk from Friends-albeit with slightly more stain-but CBGB does it with total conviction.
'CBGB' is something those clamoring, three-chord amateurs rarely were: harmless.
a moderately effective overview of the club's early years, distilled into sitcom-worthy vignettes without the kind of recklessness to make them seem truly dangerous, CBGB is the pop-punk version of a raucous, punk-rock story.
These are icons, not accessories in some Hot Topic cover version of "Teenage Lobotomy."
CBGB generally feels like a misstep, with self-aware characters all stuck in a movie that can't decide what it wants to be stylistically.
I fail to grasp the point of making this movie.
