Not since the schmaltzy Bucket List has there been a more blatant example of checklist comedy than the ultra-raunchy The To Do List.
Many of The To Do List's jokes have this first-draft, is-that-all-there-is? quality.
Don't go to The To Do List expecting a comedy genre-buster along the lines of Bridesmaids. Rather it's more of a one-joke repeater set in the hot Boise, Idaho, summer of 1993.
One more overly crude teen comedy
The film gives these people just about nothing funny to do, and it's full of both gross-out gags that don't connect and dialogue that isn't especially funny.
"The To Do List" is another one of those films that begs the question of how the writer ever thought it was a good idea.
Writer/director Maggie Carey's clodhopping coming-of-age yarn merely proves that terrible teen movies are now a source of equal-ops embarrassment for both genders.
A cast of familiar and frequently funny TV notables makes The To Do List a sweet prospect, but this tepid, oddly pitched teen comedy is unlikely to get anyone off.
I didn't believe any of it.
A few laughs.
The great Audrey Plaza is let down by weak material in this mirthless female-centric gross-out comedy.
The To Do List is an American teenage sex comedy set in 1993, which may have been the last year in which any of the cast members could have convincingly passed for a teenager.
Carey drops the ball with a script that's both meandering and mean-spirited, not to mention laughter deficient.
A muddle.
