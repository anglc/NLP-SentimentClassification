A potentially incisive character study is buried under layers of fluff in The English Teacher.
Apropos of its title, The English Teacher feels like a movie written as a homework assignment.
The report card for low-key high school comedy The English Teacher would read something like this: Weak effort; this student is too easily distracted, fails to follow through and turns in unfinished work.
The movie doesn't do enough with its cast or its idea; it's an underachiever that simply doesn't try hard enough.
In a perfect encapsulation of form and content, The English Teacher tells a story of an artist who reluctantly adds a happy ending to his play while the movie itself forces a happy ending into a story that is laced with underlying sadness.
Sharp performances can't save this ill-conceived drama set in a contemporary high school that seems to exist on some faraway planet.
Cutesy and cloying.
A strained attempt to translate the comic punch of Alexander Payne's brilliant send-up of high-school politics, Election, into the realm of an even more tension-fraught extracurricular activity: drama club.
