Syfy already has a Sharknado sequel set for next summer, but Ghost Shark probably won't have that kind of staying power. It succeeds in being more or less stupidly watchable, but unlikely to prompt anywhere near the same Twitter eruption.
Unfortunately, Ghost Shark... is no Sharknado.
[It] never approaches the laughably bad stage, settling for just plain ol' bad.
There is a peak to the insanity and it arrives too soon (and probably doesn't rise high enough).
The film violates the most crucial rule of trashy filmmaking-you can be stupid, but don't be boring.
