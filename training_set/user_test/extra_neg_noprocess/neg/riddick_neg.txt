He's spent the bulk of his career hiding in franchises, hypermasculinizing himself. We can live with this. But this new movie makes you wonder whether Diesel can.
A vibrant stylistic mishmash that works brilliantly in chunks but is ultimately too scattered to sustain any cohesion.
Riddick, an alternately kick-ass and clumsy piece of sci-fi claptrap that puts its empty head down and gets the job done.
The movie's cheap but has a sense of humor, and it's smart enough to let Riddick just get back to being a badass.
Maybe the return of Xander Cage will be better.
A general scuzziness and dinginess starts to creep over the picture like a mold ... soon, it's hard to get your heart-rate up over whether or not the coming wave of scorpo-aliens kill these scowling, sneering bags of man-meat.
Too Riddick-ulous to recommend, although a few of the more outlandish effects are a hoot (gorehounds will dig what the captive Riddick does with that machete).
