Thematic inconsistencies abound as Stevens aims for a tone somewhere between Grumpy Old Men, The Hangover, and Goodfellas.
Is it fun? Sure, some of the time. Is it good? That's a stretch. Does it tap the potential of these three actors? Fuggedaboutit.
The degree to which "Stand Up Guys" succeeds at all is completely dependent on Walken, who elevates everything around him by seemingly doing nothing at all.
The pace is too slack, the gags too tired and the plot too hackneyed for the film to be more than fitfully engaging for all but die-hard Pacino and Walken fans.
Thanks to Al Pacino, Christopher Walken, and Alan Arkin - mostly just for being charismatic old pros who are fun to hang out with - Stand Up Guys is watchable, occasionally amusing, not altogether insufferable.
Stand Up Guys probably won't appeal to anyone whose father hasn't got friends of pensionable age.
It's depressing to see the likes of Pacino reduced to making erectile dysfunction jokes, more so when the film labours the gag by having him overdose on Viagra.
Viagra is consumed, erections wrestled, old scores settled - blah blah blah.
Even when Walken, Pacino, and Arkin are phoning it in - on a rotary phone - they still earn their status as icons.
Think what they might have achieved with better material.
An initially promising, increasingly glutinous buddy comedy that exploits and squanders the talents of its starry cast.
You'd think that septuagenarians Al Pacino and Christopher Walken would still have enough self-respect left in the tank to steer clear of debacles like this.
All three acting legends bring the spice to a sub-par story. But, the total is not enough to keep this flick from stinking.
...to watch Al Pacino overact with such a deficient script and lackluster directing is agony no moviegoer should be required to endure.
