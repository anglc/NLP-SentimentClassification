Made up of four or five story ideas all crammed together, the film maintains a stop-start momentum at best that keeps it from ever hitting a solid stride.
An unconvincing, sometimes unfathomable tale about a brooding veteran (Chadwick Boseman) who was involved in a vaguely defined atrocity while fighting overseas.
A middling drama that tries to combine elements of Rambo with serious treatment of soldiers' post-traumatic stress disorder and vague political commentary.
...the serious subject of post-war trauma among Iraq veterans [folded] into a revenge and redemption scenario...sometimes interesting but all too often cartoonish.
A well meaning look at post-traumatic stress disorder and ex-military account-settling, this spare yet affected would-be thriller never ripens past the point of a wobbly character study.
