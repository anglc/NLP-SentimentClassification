"Snowpiercer" warms the heart, but doesn't penetrate it.
Like a fish past its expiration date, this train stinks from the head, and the closer the rebels get to the "Sacred Engine," the more excess baggage... gets thrown on the... tracks.
This dystopian fantasy is unpleasant enough and inhuman enough that I never want to see it again, but it is interesting visually. The acting is also very good. Octavia Spencer ("The Help") gives a knockout performance as a desperate mother.
