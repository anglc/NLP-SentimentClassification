For an old-fashioned crime thriller, you need real pros. Mr. Statham is to acting what Taco Bell is to nutrition.
Parker's vengeance isn't thrilling, there's a pointlessly developed non-love triangle, even the glam settings look cheap, and the tough-guy exchanges are inexplicably flat.
Randomly in the future you'll come upon it late one night on Starz, watch twenty minutes or so, then change the channel.
The movie seems to suffer from a misguided attempt to chase the female demo.
Calling "Parker" run-of-the-mill insults the pleasures of the potboilers it's trying to emulate. It feels like the product of misfits who broke into a mill shuttered on the edge of town and fired up the machines without understanding how they work.
Parker is a functional enough actioner but lacks pizzazz.
Even adding Jennifer Lopez to the mix in time for her to strip and show off her infamous rear doesn't add much in the way of silver screen sizzle.
If Statham harbours ambitions of making a career-defining action thriller, Parker has to be seen as another opportunity lost.
...to see [Lopez] wasted here, forced to behave girlishly and neurotically and eventually become a hostage, is insulting.
We like you, Jason. You're perfectly acceptable in near-silent, pseudo-Asian action nonsense. But you, sir, are no Lee Marvin.
Hackford approaches his task as if he's seen one of the duffer Elmore Leonard movie adaptations of recent years, or at least had one described to him.
A mediocre, poorly paced thriller ...
