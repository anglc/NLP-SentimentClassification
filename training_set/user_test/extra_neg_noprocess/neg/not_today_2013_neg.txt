Jon Van Dyke's "Not Today" doesn't qualify as a good movie, but it's built on an admirable foundation of good intentions.
Writer-director Jon Van Dyke offers rugged production values, and his real agenda - getting Christian viewers to help end sex trafficking - mires the movie in self-conscious angst and speeches.
Well-intentioned, but slow, with no urgency and a lot of preaching.
