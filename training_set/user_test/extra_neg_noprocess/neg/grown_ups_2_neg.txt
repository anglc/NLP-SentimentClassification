Sandler's films have always been stupid, but the early stuff is pretty harmless; here the jokes almost always come at the expense of someone else, the kind of needless bullying one expects of a YouTube comment section.
These movies are about four friends -- played by comedians -- remembering what it was like to be young. How much better for an audience would it be if they remembered what it was like to make comedy?
Grown Ups 2 delivers exactly what it's been advertising in trailers and on talk shows: grubby low-comic escapism.
This is pap, plain and simple: scattered raunch-lite devoid of emotional resonance.
It makes the first movie look like The Maltese Falcon.
A movie of fools, by fools, for fools.
[A] slothful, indulgent sequel that sees a once-great screen comedian hit self-inflicted Sandlergeddon.
Rob Schneider, the butt of many jokes in the first Grown-Ups, is nowhere to be seen. Salma Hayek, as Lenny's wife, looks understandably tense and irritable throughout.
The single consistent throughline Grown Ups 2 seems to have, in fact, is its bigotry.
[A] witless, clueless and utterly pointless sequel to a comedy that pulled in boatloads of cash, but was beloved by absolutely no one.
The only good news is that the five friends in the original film have been whittled down to four.
Lacking anything remotely resembling a conventional story, this ramshackle contraption is just a loosely connected collection of lame sketches taking place over the course of one very long day.
Transgender jokes, fat jokes (always James, happy to look stupid), homeliness jokes, mama's boy jokes -- the picture was made by people who like to put down people, and it was made for people who like to tease others or watch others be insulted.
Dreadful.
Directing once again is schlock auteur Dennis Dugan, and the result is an $80 million YouTube video.
"Grown Ups 2" takes its rightful place in the pantheon of terrible films, becoming just another one to avoid like your life depended on it.
Grown Ups 2 is the culmination and epitome of laziness not just for Sandler, his friends, or director Dennis Dugan, but comedy as a genre.
The leads dampen the delivery with a noticeable lack of energy. It's telling when the most charismatic comedic performance comes from Taylor Lautner...
This is not a movie. This is nothing but Adam Sandler hanging out with his pals and congratulating himself on how awesome he finds himself to be.
There was nothing remotely notable about 2010's Grown Ups, and now we have a sequel that's even lazier.
Somehow, the word 'sequel' doesn't fit: it would be like describing three months of agonising spinal surgery as the sequel to falling off a cliff.
As disposable and forgettable as its 2010 predecessor...
It's easy to be critical of films which have no aim other than to entertain, but if you're half way to Sandler's juvenile, rather sexist mentality you will find more comedy highlights than you'll be expecting.
No human being possesses the imaginative power to sufficiently lower his or her expectations to anticipate the sheer laziness of this putrid ensemble comedy.
