The film tries to paint in shades of gray with vague criticisms of the war on drugs, but the absurdity of its he-man Everyman plot ends up turning its moral palette a muddy brown.
Dwayne Johnson tries so hard to be taken seriously in the ponderous and preposterous drama Snitch that it hurts to watch him in much the same way it hurts to watch the weightlifting competition at the summer Olympics.
Ultimately, unfortunately, this is a property that probably would have been better as one of Johnson's old, less ambitious films - straightforwardly violent, and crammed with two-fisted revenge - than as this more polite, issue-oriented thriller.
A pseudo-serious hand-wringing action drama that uses social importance to disguise its unoriginality.
Snitch wants to be Breaking Bad. When the camera's on Johnson, it's just bad.
Teeth are gritted, shaven-heads stroked, families hugged, moist-eyes blinked - but it's the sight of big things getting smashed to pieces that endures, and ultimately bores.
Its smaller, quieter moments instill hope that Johnson can stretch even further and become worthy of much stronger material.
If Snitch ultimately perishes from over-ambition, at least it's an honourable death.
Good intentions are all but submerged in nonsense.
Spurious isn't the word. Po-faced anti-drug film based on the silliest legal loophole ever.
Neither clever nor stupid enough to work.
The script can't quite decide whether it's a serious emotional drama or a pumped-up action flick and it ends up disappointing on both counts as a result.
What's undeniably credibility-cracking is the idea of The Rock as an Ordinary Joe in jeopardy.
