It's not gruesome enough to please genre fans, but not nearly funny enough to be a comedy either. It tries to be a mixture of both and fails.
A muddled teenpic.
Warm Bodies doesn't even have the conviction to follow through on its lame ideas, let alone its good ones. It's a mostly terrible film that misses the opportunity to be a merely mediocre one.
I imagine if Taylor Swift made horror movies, "Warm Bodies" would be one of her creations.
