Even with performers as likable as Hader and Wiig, and characters as likable as Milo and Maggie, sympathy should be earned. Like an cocksure banker, Johnson takes our investment for granted.
Wiig, Wilson and Hader all give great performances in this movie, almost enough to lift it out of the dark emotional pit at the heart of the story. It doesn't quite make it there in this comedy about a suicidal family.
Despite revelatory performances from its two leads, this is a pretty miserable movie that will leave you wondering why you subjected yourself to such a downer.
There is the risk of a credibility gap when charismatic and successful stars play ultra- dysfunctional types. That's why Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig never quite convince as Milo and Maggie, twins on the cusp of middle age.
A bold experiment which doesn't quite come together.
