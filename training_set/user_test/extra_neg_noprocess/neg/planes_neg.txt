A visually colorful but otherwise vanilla continuation of the series.
Strictly by the numbers, from the believe-in-yourself moral to the purely predictable ending.
Has the look and feel of Pixar's 2006 hit, "Cars," if not the latter's charm or strong story.
"Planes" is for the most part content to imitate rather than innovate, presumably hoping to reap a respectable fraction of the box office numbers of "Cars" and "Cars 2," which together made hundreds of millions of dollars.
As with "Cars," the world of "Planes" feels safe. A little too safe, perhaps.
...rarely manages to achieve the heights achieved even by 2006's entertaining yet lackluster Cars...
It's a shame that Disney and Pixar aren't in the 'classic-making' business anymore; just the 'distraction-making' business.
A direct-to-video-quality spin-off that only exists to sell toys.
While kids might respond to the fast-paced airborne antics, the humor isn't clever enough or the story surprising enough to satisfy accompanying grown-ups.
