Iron Man 3 has good things in it, enough to please the series' fans -- and yet too many drawbacks to win many converts.
The trouble is that, as the plot quickens, any cleverness withdraws, to make way for the firecrackers of the climax. That is not Black's forte, and his movie duly slumps into a mess.
Iron Man 3 feels like an exploitative mulching of present-day anxieties. The script is ambitious but not wise enough to be rightfully cathartic. It's more Cuisinart than art.
The action, directed by Shane Black, ranges from passable to interminable.
Iron Man 3 is an decent movie that really should have been far better with this pedigree.
