Likely to inspire much exiting stage left and right.
Writer-director Jerome Sable, who co-wrote the songs with Eli Batalion, has a sharp ear for musical pastiche, from Andrew Lloyd Weber to heavy metal. But he comes up flat on the horror-musical spoof.
Give the movie some zip, a few memorable songs and a stronger third act, and (to paraphrase Mr. Sondheim) something good's just out of reach.
This horror musical has about 20 comically inspired minutes before devolving into increasingly moribund genre-spoofing territory.
Whether it's being sexy, jokey or homicidal, "Stage Fright" doesn't deliver the goods with sufficient spirit. It lacks the sparkle to be a truly killer show.
Too bad Stage Fright isn't a better movie.
Stage Fright almost works as a pitch-perfect parody of '80s b-grade slashers, but succumbs to many of the genre's same weaknesses.
With such broad comedic targets, the film would have been better off poking fun at its disparate elements instead of paying tribute.
Strangely straightforward for being an episode of Glee attached to a paint-by-numbers slasher flick, Human Centipede-style.
Stage Fright tries too damn hard to sit with theater kids at lunch but secretly considers them losers.
...a pointless and often interminable mess.
More contrived than clever, "Stage Fright" wants to be the musical version of "Scream." It isn't.
Starts out promisingly as "Friday the 13th" meets "Glee," complete with musical numbers...(but) sadly becomes way too serious as well as excessively gory.
"Stage Fright" could have been so much fun.
Writer/director Jerome Sable fills his script full of so many leftover plot elements and references to other movies that it chokes the life right out of it.
The world needs more campy rock musicals starring Meat Loaf. But not this.
