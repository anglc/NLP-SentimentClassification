When the movie veers away from the verbal gymnastics of a bunch of colorful dopes out-dumbing one another and into overindulged farce, the specificity of the Coens' writing begins to fade.
This nominal remake of the 1966 art caper that starred Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine has all the fizz of flat soda ...
"Gambit" is a trans-Atlantic delivery of "meh."
Firth is solid as always. He fits his tailored suits and rectangular glasses to a T. Diaz fares less well.
'Gambit' is like drinking cheap, warm champagne from a plastic cup.
Even with a script by the Coen brothers, and a classy international cast led by Colin Firth, this contemporary London caper movie falls far short of its potential even as a lightweight comic romp.
So-so remake of '60s caper has slapstick, brief nudity.
... feels like a first draft of a dusty script that was pulled from the bottom of a drawer without being polished prior to production.
Firth and Diaz, game as they are, look lost and disappointed most of the time during Gambit, as though they pictured themselves making Burn After Reading, and instead found themselves in The Ladykillers.
The director behind Soapdish and The Last Station is generally reliable, but he can't keep up with the Coens' fast paced dialogue.
It's mirthless, languid and obvious. Well, you can relate.
A flat-footed remake of a mildly amusing 1966 caper movie ...
Given the quality of the film, we must assume that these Coens are no relation to the siblings who make films that rarely encourage you to poke out your eyes with rusty scissors.
The mood isn't so much vintage as instantly old-hat.
In spite of its strong cast and decent premise, something feels slightly off with Gambit.
Diaz's smile lights up the screen, though her role struggles to be as much as one-dimensional.
You'll smile a few times and the cast work hard but interest and goodwill fizzles out.
