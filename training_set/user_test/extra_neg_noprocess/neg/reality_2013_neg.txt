The satire here is finespun, and the film's conclusions ambiguous.
The story is too slight.
My disappointment comes not just from the fact that the subject matter is soft but from the fact that the film is so thin
The themes involving the confused sense of today's reality hit a note, (but) the film is not funny enough, nor interesting enough to hold our attention for its 116 minute running time
As soon as the reality show element comes in, the movie abandons its creativity and goes for broad, anxious comedy that never works.
