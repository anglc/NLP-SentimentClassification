"Love and Honor'' may be politically clueless, but Hemsworth and the student journalist he hooks up with (fellow Aussie Teresa Palmer of "Warm Bodies'') do make an undeniably attractive couple.
This trifle about two soldiers who sneak away to America while on leave unfolds in a world about as realistic as a flashback on a sitcom.
Hemsworth has presence, but he also represents this film's biggest problem: It feels like a bunch of good-looking kids putting on a show.
Everybody learns something about the illusion of love and the power of honor. It's hard to believe it wasn't written by Nicholas Sparks.
It's a lightweight drama filled with heavyweight war-is-hell monologues, delivered by a cast that lacks the gravity to sell them.
little more than a counterfeit Nicholas Sparks adaptation
A well meaning but essentially dopey period piece film that tries with increasingly diminishing effectiveness to meld an anti-war message with Nicholas Sparks-type romance.
The attempt at gritty period re-creation seems half-hearted and unconvincing, the screenplay is strictly formula, and most of the primary actors have done better work elsewhere.
Totally bogus anti-war film, set in a 1969 that bears no resemblance to any actual period.
Love and Honor is capable of much more than predictable melodrama, though director Danny Mooney seems absolutely determined to ease this effort into a honeyed coma as quickly as possible.
The deceptions and romances carry on as one might expect, all while the film makes some attempt at exploring the cultural shifts of the time period.
