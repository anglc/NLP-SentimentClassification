A sloppy chiller about tourists falling prey to an online stalker in Bangkok that clumsily mixes slasher, sexploitation and supernatural elements.
Somehow "Cam2Cam," directed by Joel Soisson, falls spectacularly short for the genres it hopes to pander in: slasher pic, soft-core, travelogue.
Its supposedly percipient musings on modern love clash with the unshakeable feeling that the film feels like a relic unearthed from a high-school hard drive.
If Cam2Cam was a Chatroulette user, you'd pass by this cyber snoozer without hesitation. Next!
