Predictable animated swashbuckler with a few chuckles.
A generally dreadful, sub-par animation.
This disappointing CG animation fails to capture the sense of fairytale wonder that its narrative requires.
Seeking to match the comic pizzazz of Shrek, Puss in Boots and Brave, Spanish-made animated adventure Justin and the Knights of Valour falls disappointingly short, despite the best efforts of a very game, mostly British voice cast.
A strong cast on paper, but you wonder if this is a collective sales pitch to make up for the lack of energy on the screen.
The action is clunky, the jokes fall flat time and again, and the script tries so hard to get off the ground that you can almost feel the wind hitting you in the kisser from its frantic wing-flaps.
The frantic plot and shrill comic relief make for a disappointing dud.
It doesn't look bad, but the spark of originality and interest is lacking.
If imitation is flattery, the makers of How To Train Your Dragon and the Oscar-winning Brave must never have felt flatter.
An underwhelming saga, told with the verve of a medieval video game.
It may have Antonio Banderas and Rupert Everett on board, but this 3D cartoon about a would-be knight is more dreck than Shrek.
Even Banderas' character feels like a cheap knock-off, who is not fit to polish the boots of Puss.
