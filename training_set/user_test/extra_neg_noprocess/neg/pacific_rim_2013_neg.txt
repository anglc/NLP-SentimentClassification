Its visual achievements notwithstanding, Pacific Rim's greatest breakthrough may be that it's the first Hollywood blockbuster to sport a title less descriptive of its plot than of its intended market.
It's as if Del Toro neuro-linked with a robot and then couldn't figure out how to work the controls -- and so watched impotently as the machine made the major creative decisions.
All the unpredictability of professional wrestling plus the magic of synchronized Stairmasters -- that's what I got out of the vaunted spectacle of Pacific Rim.

Pacific Rim is a special-effects behemoth, a toy franchise with a deafeningly loud movie attached -- Transformers with an A-level.
In essence, Pacific Rim features a series of Godzilla monsters battle an ever dwindling number of Transformers, layered over the plot from Independence Day, only dumber.
There was a time when I would have considered Pacific Rim the greatest movie ever made. But then I turned 12.
...a punishing ordeal that just might mark the nadir of the modern big-budget blockbuster...
