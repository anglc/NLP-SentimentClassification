Despite the tissue-thin plot, slipshod performances and predictable single-mum family dynamics 'Robosapien' is surprisingly easy to endure - a freewheeling kids' film. Nothing more, nothing less.
The film's cloak-and dagger plot barely passes muster, but Cody's antics - which include break dancing, tantrum throwing and blowing raspberries - will probably appeal to those young viewers whose behaviour they mimic.
There may be shades of E.T. To this, but it just hasn't got that depth or emotional edge that makes kids films so poignantly well-rounded at times.
Inspired by the titular toy, Robosapien combines CGI and live action with fairly banal results.
