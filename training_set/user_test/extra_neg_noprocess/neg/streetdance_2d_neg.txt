So slapped together it feels less like a movie than an extended montage...
If you're hoping for intricate plotting, suspense or even nominal character development, StreetDance 2 is unlikely to waltz away with your heart.
Energetic dance routines interrupted now and then by unlikely dialogue and wooden acting: Welcome to StreetDance 2.
Like almost all dance films, Streetdance 2 has failed to find extremely talented dancers who are also even remotely credible actors.
All the sentiments about 'being all you can be' fall somewhat flat against the cynically commercial feel of StreetDance 2's enterprise, which credits the audience with one brain-cell each.
It's cornier than a field full of maize, of course, but its lack of scrappy charm renders it so tedious...
As a piece of catchy pop culture, the StreetDance franchise has a natural buzz - just don't expect much more than awesome moves for your money.
Directors Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini use too much flashy editing, which detracts from the dancing. The final showdown is particularly disappointing.
You'll realise you're the one who is going to be tangoed.
Tom Conti is good value as a fleet-footed bar owner and the dance sequences are vigorously staged but the story is plodding and perfunctory and has no connection with the earlier film...
