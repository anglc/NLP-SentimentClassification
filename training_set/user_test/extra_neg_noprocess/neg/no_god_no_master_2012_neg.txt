No God, No Master has an authentic period feel. But Green is focused on so many historical figures and potential storylines that the film feels rushed and, at times, confusing.
A film that probably should have been called "No Ambien? No Problem!"
A series of issue-driven snapshots instead of something genuinely illuminating.
Interesting politics done in by so-so filmmaking.
