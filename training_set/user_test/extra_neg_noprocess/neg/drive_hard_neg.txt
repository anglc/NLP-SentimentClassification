It's no fresher than its title - a long chase movie with Cusack as master thief and Thomas Jane as his reluctant accomplice.
You know there's something fundamentally wrong with Drive Hard less than five seconds in: It opens on a shot of star Thomas Jane sporting an absurd mop of a hairdo that might have been borrowed from a Raggedy Ann doll.
Approximately as unforgettable as its title ...
Normally, I would have no objection to being trapped in a car with John Cusack, but that was before I saw "Drive Hard."
[It] doesn't exactly work up a sweat devising an interesting plot villains, but the badinage between the odd couple ... makes the time pass painlessly enough.
Very disappointing potboiler that runs out of gas far too quickly.
Delivers a goodly amount of good natured action fun but in the end suffers from being just too low-key for its own good.
"Drive Hard" is just a bore, barely registering as a movie, which is a shame, because with the oddball cast and somewhat notable director, it could have been fun and trashy.
A deeply terrible would-be action comedy that looks, sounds, and feels like an 80s cheap and cheesy made-for-cable movie.
Sputtering on fumes almost from the start, it captures a well-earned checkered flag as one of the worst films of 2014.
Feels like the work of a computer program that analyzed dozens of popular movies in different genres, then self-generated a screenplay that tried to incorporate elements from all of them.
It's dumb. It's ugly. And yet it's not all bad.
Falls a little flat, never quite secure in its insanity and perhaps a bit too ambitious with its screenplay, which spends more time building secretive allegiances than it does tending to the visceral highlights.
Just as egregious as its retrograde sexual politics, however, is the film's distinct lack of energy or wit -- shortcomings that ultimately render it merely a cruddy B-movie throwaway.
This movie is so colorless, odorless, and (especially) tasteless, so devoid of mass or substance, that it's easy to forget even while it's still playing.
Scruffy, low budget, the driving is weak but in some weird way, Jane and Cusack have chemistry and make this fitfully amusing.
