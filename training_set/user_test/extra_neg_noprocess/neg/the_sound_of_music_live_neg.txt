Without Underwood and Moyer selling us on this legendary love story, The Sound of Music Live plays like very expensive karaoke.
In terms of feeling like this production genuinely delivered, that's one mountain The Sound of Music Live! just couldn't climb.
Seeing The Sound of Music on DVD minus the live element (and its driving, hate watch-fueled Twitter traffic) makes it seem like an even bigger mess.
If anything, it made me truly appreciate the amazing talent that is Julie Andrews -- and how critical it is to have a talent like this as the lynchpin for a project as important as this one.
For as much as Underwood strained to get some of the musical numbers down pat, it was watching her try to emote as the beloved Maria that was truly the hardest thing to stomach.
