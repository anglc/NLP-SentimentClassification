Despite a finely wrought lead performance by Dakota Fanning, the drama feels more like the stuff of a mild - and dated - YA novel than an involving exploration of female experience.
One insurmountable problem is that the stars, especially Ms. Olsen, 25, are too old for their roles. Another is that the movie has more characters than it can begin to accommodate in 91 minutes.
Disappointingly, Foner's young heroines are defined primarily by their reactions to other people. It's a great credit to Olsen and, especially, Fanning that they manage to make these characters vibrant and sympathetic anyway.
A drama that feels like an old person's idea of what young people are like.
Holbrook acts as a discount Ryan Gosling -- all the mumbling and silence at just 20 percent of the charisma.
Youthful cliches trump insight in Very Good Girls.
Appreciably different and well acted throughout, and sincerely engaging in patches... [but] ultimately succumbs to sigh-inducing artificiality.
The film treats a complicated experience with painstaking simplicity.
Bland, brooding coming-of-age drama wastes talented cast.
It rings false in its portrayal of sisterhood and coming-of-age angst.
An almost complete waste of a talented cast, and all to, apparently, convince teenaged girls that sex isn't worth the hassle. Say what?
Will any film this year feature a moment more pretentious than David asking Lily to read a few lines of Sylvia Plath's poetry before their first kiss? That guy deserves a smack to the kisser all right.
[E]very conflict here arises from situations that could be easily resolved if the characters sat down to talk for a few minutes...
Limp and insincere from bottom to top, Very Good Girls is especially frustrating in that its innate lousiness is more than even Fanning and Olsen can overcome.
You keep wishing it were better.
More of a meandering, misguided path than a road to hell, Naomi Foner's directing debut, starring Dakota Fanning and Elizabeth Olsen as 18-year-old BFFs, is similarly filled with good intentions.
Girls reveals plenty of potential, but nothing gels as Foner imagines, making the feature appealing and honest, but only periodically.
