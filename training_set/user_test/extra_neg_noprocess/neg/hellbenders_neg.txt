Aided by capable if unnecessary 3D effects, Petty displays a flair for staging violent action, but he's trapped inside a broad comic set-up that doesn't mesh with the story's innate meanness.
Hellbenders doesn't take any risks, leaving the horror at too low a level and trying to get comedy from a situation where there isn't any, making this nothing more than a very forgettable film.
It's a shame this story about sinning saints doesn't provide the necessary shock and awe entertainment, because director J.T. Petty is sitting on some serious cult cinema potential - it just never is achieved.
Expends so much time and effort in trying to become the next big cult sensation that it never gets around to simply being a good movie.
Hellbenders mostly feels like a doodle, an amiable lark that will amuse genrephiles and anyone else with their sights set appropriately low.
