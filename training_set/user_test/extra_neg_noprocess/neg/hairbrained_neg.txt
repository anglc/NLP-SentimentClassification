A campus comedy that tries to transcend its many formulaic elements with an insufficient dose of absurdism.
"HairBrained" is painfully contrived and self-consciously quirky from the word go.
Unfortunately, the movie lacks strong enough players to fill in subtext to Mr. Kent's formulaic setups, and the story flounders once Ms. Posey is out of the picture.
Aside from some nice autumnal shots of Ivy League college campuses, there's nothing in HairBrained to sustain much interest.
Early potential fizzles away too quickly in this underachieving buddy comedy, which just barely skids along on the charm of its co-stars.
Poorly thought-out serio-comedy
HairBrained is a rather dumb comedy about a sharply intelligent mind, failing due to flat characters, cliched plotting and minimal laughs.
Hairbrained has a lot of good stuff. There is nothing egregiously wrong with the film. It just needs more of that good stuff.
Often caught trying too hard, forcing the feature into positions that fail to extract the simple joys of the premise and its idiosyncratic lead character.
"HairBrained" is stuck in one of those strained, superficial movie worlds that resemble Earth, but bear few commonalities with real life and human behavior. The experience of watching it is frustrating, then obnoxious in its too-cute adorkableness.
As a buddy comedy, HairBrained has a few precious moments of male bonding between Fraser and Wolff, but their mismatched friendship yields few laughs and never feels genuine.
HAIRBRAINED feels like a throwback to college comedies of 1980s cable TV.
Too bad that the film's funniest personalities, Parker Posey and Fred Melamed, have the smallest parts.
