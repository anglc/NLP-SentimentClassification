This oater with shades of Weird West comic books has a plot too easy to foretell and a thrill level that dips with the rising of the body count.
A revenge-fantasy Western that wants to luxuriate in its B-movie roots but suffers from dull direction and an even duller central performance.
It bludgeons with intent, even dabbling in some "Deadwood"-level verbal shock-and-awe; without wit or intelligence, it's merely baroque affectation playacting at depth.
As violent act begets silly exchange begets another violent act, "Sweetwater" squanders its noteworthy resources ...
There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes than with a mediocre Western.
A handsomely designed, occasionally funny but ultimately empty female vengeance yarn.
The west has never been less gritty, less pulpy than it is here, with the locale fading into the background when it should be a character in its own right.
Sarah's would-be parade of vengeance makes for a bloody but bland reckoning.
Unwatchable- one of the worst movies I've ever seen at Sundance.
The tone in Sweetwater is as heavy as that firepower, and the film can feel like stiff medicine.
