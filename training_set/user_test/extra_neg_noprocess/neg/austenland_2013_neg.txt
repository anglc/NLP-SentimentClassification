The acting throughout falls into two registers; pantomime mugging for most of the cast, while the romantic leads, Russell and Feild, look so ill at ease that you pity them.
"Austenland" understands Austen's enduring romantic appeal but has no use for her deeper themes of class, wealth and gender inequality.
It's tentative in its intentions and afraid to push all the way with its premise. It is not sharp enough as a comedy, and when it tries to shift gears and become a romance, it is unconvincing in its machinations.
A mildly surprising and completely heartwarming ending casts a glow over the previous 96 minutes of "Austenland" but can't wipe out all regrets for what might have been.
Everything rings false, and the spectacle of bad actors pretending to be bad actors may trouble your sleep for some time.
