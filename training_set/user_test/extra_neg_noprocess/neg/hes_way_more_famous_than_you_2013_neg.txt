Self-pity, self-parody and self-destruction are blurred to cringe-inducing effect in He's Way More Famous Than You.
The screenplay never meshes its ideas into one satirical story or even a series of sketches with individually coherent points. A little meta goes a long, long way.
Feiffer sometimes gets snagged on the look-at-me nature of her meta-performance, veering from pathological to pathetic, and not always in the best way.
While on some level, He's Way More Famous Than You successfully skewers the cult of celebrity and the entertainment business, it ultimately marginalizes itself from the audience because of the un-likability of the leading character.
It would have been nice if the film had surrendered to its lunacy more blatantly, more carelessly.
