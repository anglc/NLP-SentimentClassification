The movie's found-footage conceit never creates a proper atmosphere, something essential to any horror film but particularly one involving the occult.
A disjointed and unconvincing movie that is also embarrassingly derivative of "Paranormal Activity."
Dredging up horror movie favorites like random nosebleeds, a traumatized priest and a mama-to-be with a yen for raw meat, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett direct with competence but a dispiriting lack of originality.
At least there's a credible premise in "Devil's Due," an otherwise feeble exercise in the found-footage form.
