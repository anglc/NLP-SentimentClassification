Bombastic and pedestrian at the same time.
A feature-length commercial for the Jay-Z brand.
It's kind of interesting to watch Opie hang with Jay-Z and Eddie Vedder, but it doesn't really add value to anyone's image. It just feels like we've been given backstage access to a big show and we're being chaperoned every second.
Have you long dreamed of watching Skrillex explain his process to Ron Howard? Then "Made in America" was made for you. Otherwise?
The unlikely team-up of rapper/businessman Jay Z and filmmaker Ron Howard doesn't result in odd-couple fireworks. Try familiar yawns instead.
Made In America is an all-too-accurate reflection of the safe, boring, middle-aged politician Jay-Z has become.
Made In America's ode to opportunity and achievement begs for a deeper reality check.
What could have been a spirited dissection of Jay-Z's optimistic enterprise is instead merely an advertisement for it.
