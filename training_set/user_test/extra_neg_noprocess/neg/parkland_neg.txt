Kennedy specialists will glean nothing new, and those hoping for sobriety will flinch at the camera's intrusions.
Somehow, all this commotion adds up to aimless inertia, in part because the movie lacks a point of view - let alone anything fresh to propose about the assassination or its peripheral players.
Takes one of the most traumatizing events of the American 20th century and turns it into a trivia digest.
For those who remember that dark day, it will inevitably have impact. But this was too much of a story for one film.
Had Landesman spent a bit more time on his characters and narrative, he might have made a more watchable movie.
Ultimately Parkland is not thought-provoking, inspiring or even brave enough to be offensive, but it does raise some interesting scenarios and is full of some very solid acting.
Parkland remains a bystander in the already overcrowded field of films about the events of November 1963.
A personal history of a very public disaster that fails to hit as hard as it might as the voices chosen aren't strong enough as written to speak for the people who were there on the day President Kennedy came to town.
It's slick and well acted (by Paul Giamatti, Zac Efron and Billy Bob Thornton, among others), but this attempt to make new sense of the death of JFK feels staggeringly pointless.
You can't help feeling that there's more to this story than ever meets the eye.
The monumental hand-wringing about Kennedy feels, the further we get away from the event, somehow inappropriate.
A recreation of a tragedy just for the sake of it, with no driving purpose or worthwhile insight except for those curious how to get a coffin on to a plane's passenger section.
As pure docudrama Parkland is a let down. As a tribute to a great political leader it's bordering on insult.
