Some bad movies just bore you, while others create a perverse fascination, an aura that keeps you watching in the hope they will never get better. "The Twelve Disasters of Christmas" does not.
12 Disasters Of Christmas, SyFy's contribution to the holiday season, lands on the programming calendar like a foul-smelling, coal-like substance left on the carpet by a drunken Santa who needs a swat on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper.
Viewers who have had their fills of prototypical Christmas movie cheer might want to get into the proper Syfy spirit by priming themselves with their favorite spirits.
It's the TV equivalent of finding socks under your tree.
