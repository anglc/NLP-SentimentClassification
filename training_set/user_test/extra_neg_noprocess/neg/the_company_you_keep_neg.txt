This is the most depressing movie ever made about radicalism.
You can't help but applaud the effort, even as it falls short.
Redford is an adequate director, and he keeps things moving at a moderate pace, passing up exits to more spectacular vistas or hotter issues.
What gets revealed should rattle, but it doesn't.
Far and away the most impressive thing about it is that Redford's ability to convince his famous friends to appear in small roles.
Dreadfully near-catatonic pace that never makes you feel like there's much at stake.
Things come together satisfyingly at the end, but by then the urge to jump out of one's theater seat has been in effect for at least 45 minutes.
A tougher work might have seemed provocatively relevant in the tragic context of current events, but this film has a muted nostalgia for the days when bomb-tossing students had easy-to-pronounce names and might grow up to be as cleancut as Robert Redford.
Clearly, Redford has no trouble drawing talent; if he's ever interested in remaking Meteor or Midnight in Paris, he's halfway there.
Robert Redford -- who once was an active liberal -- is now a tired capitalist. He's also a worn-out egotist.
No matter how much slack you cut it, The Company You Keep never quite lives up to expectation.
