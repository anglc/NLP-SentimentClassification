A moderately smart movie would have pushed back against the formula. That Awkward Moment simply mistakes being obnoxious for being clever.
The movie's ideas about relationships would've felt middle-of-the-road in the '80s, and its big epiphany moments (Guys can fall in love, too!) are shallow enough to make you long for the comparatively profound rom-com oeuvre of Kate Hudson.
First-time writer-director Tom Gormican keeps the dialogue moving at a rapid pace, which doesn't obscure the fact that most of what is said is dopey and witless.
Only a sociopath would behave this carelessly, and as such, That Awkward Moment makes for an interesting study in abnormal criminal behavior.
