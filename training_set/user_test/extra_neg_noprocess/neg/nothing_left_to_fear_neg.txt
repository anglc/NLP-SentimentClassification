When a family is as generic as the Bramfords, you get a little antsy waiting for them to be killed off one by one.
Memo to Rob Zombie: Don't fear the competition.
Deploys zero humor or wit before moving straight to the sacrificing of a teen girl (always, it's a girl).
The familiar special effects are not the most disappointing element here. It's the squandering of the talented Ms. Heche, who is given top billing but almost nothing to do.
"Nothing Left to Fear" is true to its title. Director Anthony Leonardi III and writer Jonathan Mills have let not one scary moment on screen.
It's a mind numbing, and amateurishly directed horror outing...
Nothing Left To Fear benefits from a genuinely creepy atmosphere in its first half and from competent acting all round... Unfortunately this isn't enough to overcome the problems that stem from a formulaic plot and a lack of ideas in the second half.
Nothing Left to Fear is a mild disappointment - as the foundation for a rich mythology that goes too unexplored to be memorable, much less meaningful, it leaves plenty left indeed to be afraid of.
Nothing Left to Fear gets your hopes up, but by the time it's over the metaphorical throat of those hopes has been slit from ear to ear. The film seems to make a mockery of you as you bleed out and a new song from Slash plays over the end credits.
Well, at least the effects are fear-worthy.
It's stale B-movie rubbish of a barely watchable sort.
