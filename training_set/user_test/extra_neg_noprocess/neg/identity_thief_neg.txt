You don't care enough about these people to want to see them come out on top.
It saddles Bateman with a thankless uptight straight-man role while heaping serial slapstick ignominies on his co-star, who gamely bounds through everything the script throws at her.
Identity Thief is funny enough, but it needed to be darker, raunchier, and crazier to live up to the promise of its casting.
[A] sloppily made exercise of rip-offs and redemption.
Considering that it starts out with two distinctive and likable stars and a reasonably promising premise, "Identity Thief" reaches impressive heights of laziness and idiocy.
...utterly confused over what to do with McCarthy as a physical comedienne.
It's like Midnight Run while at the same time completely missing what makes Midnight Run work. Melissa McCarthy deserves better.
Bateman and McCarthy thrash around in the dark for laughs that never come.
This ugly and rather mean-spirited film, with jokes that are so lowbrow they're totally underfoot, creaks through a number of recycled road trip gags.
The gags mostly grab at low-hanging fruit, frittering away the marvelous potential of Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy on an odd-couple road trip.
The natural charisma of the two leads is about the only thing that saves Identity Thief; it's a very generic, very lazy Hollywood comedy.
Very little about Identity Thief is original. After a brief introduction that leads to Sandy and Diana travelling across the country together, viewers are saddled with a story that's essentially a road movie with an Odd Couple twist.
Bateman and McCarthy seem inspired enough to make this janky old jalopy of a story somewhat entertaining, playing to type with a lukewarm script.
...a yawner plot set-up that leads to lots of wannabe off-colour gags, a small army of pursuing villains and an expected final act in which Jason's icky-sticky niceness might perhaps stop McCarthy from being a shrieking psychopath.
Formulaic multiplex mulch, way over-long, often feels strained...That said, Identity Thief is the latest example of the disconnect that often exists between critical opinion and popular appeal. Slammed by critics the low-budget film has been a huge hit.
Identity Thief molests the idea of the 'odd couple' beyond recognition.
Don't let Identity Thief steal two hours of your life.
The film's darker elements are brushed aside and we're left with a zany, feel-good finale.
an unwieldy and unfunny farce that's robbed of comic potential through its reliance on shrill mayhem over wit.
When the plot feels like you've seen it three times before, and done better on each of those occasions, the movie better have something else going for it. Identity Thief doesn't.
The first thing I did after returning from the screening was take two painkillers for my throbbing headache. A man can only withstand so much shrill shrieking and faux-screwball antics.
There's probably a funny film buried somewhere deep within this concept of a morally corrupt protagonist, whose compulsion to steal identities finds her facing off with the man whose identity she has stolen, but this isn't it
Identity Thief features the kind of 'humour' which says you don't just hit a person once, you should do it repeatedly to make it funnier.
