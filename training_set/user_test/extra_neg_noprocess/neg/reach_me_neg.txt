At times "Reach Me" is undeniably intriguing, mostly because it's just so weird and disconnected. Eventually, though, it just becomes tiresome.
Nothing in the proceedings is remotely convincing, let alone entertaining.
'Reach Me' is the sort of movie where careers go to die.
A kitchen-sink mess with no discernible narrative drive or thematic resonance beyond uninspired batches of bad behavior, gunplay, eccentricity and weak uplift.
Casting Sylvester Stallone as a gossip-site publisher obviously modeled on Matt Drudge is one of many counterintuitive ideas that backfire in "Reach Me."
The score works overtime to assert what kind of movie this is, sometimes shifting several times within a single scene. Choices include a low-rent thriller, a contemplative drama, and a slick Elmore Leonard-style crime farce. None of them stick.
The jokes aren't funny and the earnest stabs at emotional sincerity ring false in this ensemble melodrama.
Herzfeld is determined to make these puzzle pieces fit, yet there isn't much to solve with Reach Me, which gradually limps to a cop-out close.
Reach Me feels lazy, in desperate need of its own motivational speech.
Reach Me takes a long list of cliches -- some more offensive than others -- and mixes them all together with a fancy cast to make a boring, pretentious film. Reach for an actual book instead.
A toneless mess that's more chaotic than soul-searching, more irritating than meditative.
Once you've sunk into the entirely warped groove of "Reach Me" you're almost eager to experience the next offense against aesthetics and/or common sense it is poised to commit.
The characters keep bumping into one another like a cut-rate Crash, only to drift apart until the plot needs another twist
Herzfeld appears to have a worldview more formed by [bad] movies and TV shows than by any experience of day-to-day life as a human being on Earth.
Somehow, this thin script attracted that star sprinkled cast.
