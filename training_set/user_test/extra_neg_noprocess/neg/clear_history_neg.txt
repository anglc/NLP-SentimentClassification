If you're a fan of Curb Your Enthusiasm, think of this as an extended version of Curb. If you're not, History will not convert you.
Clear History was improvised from 35 pages of script. "You are such an asshole!" one Vineyard resident tells Flomm, which is the movie's main revelation.
Even if you do like David's shtick, as I do, you have no business here.
Because HBO will basically let him do whatever he wants, Larry David passed up making another season of Curb Your Enthusiasm to instead write and star in this semi-improvised feature that has an A-list cast and C-list material.
Fans of Larry David could easily be won over by Clear History but ultimately, a fun cast and genuine laughs are unable to outshine its many inconsistencies.
Clear History is ultimately a disappointing endeavor that's rarely able to live up to the high standard set by star Larry David's television show, Curb Your Enthusiasm.
Clear History's shorthanded characterizations and ethical vacuum prove so flaccid that it fails even if one views it as a nihilistic statement.
The problem with an extended episode of Curb, which is brilliant in its own demented way, is that Larry David's idiosyncrasies can grate even the most patient of fans.
