Though disappointing content-wise, McCarthy's sophomore feature still demonstrates admirable attention to things that usually suffer in more superficially flashy horror efforts ...
Things pick up, but too late to really have any impact.
This is the sort of cinematic patchwork from which Brian De Palma made his name, yet the style and playfulness of Mr. De Palma's work are absent.
Creepy atmospherics aren't enough to compensate for the muddled storyline.
McCarthy lends some visual flair to the generic material, but the clumsy screenplay turns a potentially compelling premise into an incoherent mess.
McCarthy's marvelously unnerving set pieces are in service to a headscratcher of a story that never coagulates.
Despite its thick, creepy atmosphere and sinister tone, the biggest flaw At the Devil's Door has is that it is constantly knocking on the door of a nightmarish journey and yet it isn't tenacious enough to take that first step inside.
In his attempt to pull "At the Devil's Door" inside out, McCarthy has forgotten to retain a gripping consistency to the work, rendering the effort distanced when it should snowball into something menacing.
Haunted houses and devilish deals are done to death, but Devil's Door, to its credit, tries a few things new and takes a handful of unexpected twists.
An accumulation of dread in search of a properly fleshed-out screenplay to sustain it, the film plays like a show reel for writer-director Nicholas McCarthy's considerable craft.
Deals up some infernal imagery that chillingly toys with concepts of identity and the unknown, yet these individual moments do not collectively build to anything of note.
Like a giant gob of peanut butter without any bread, McCarthy's film is an empty smother of tense disquiet that tastes fine, but sticks to the roof of the mouth.
Many fine talents are thrown into this witch's cauldron of chopped-off bits from other horror films, but it doesn't cohere.
