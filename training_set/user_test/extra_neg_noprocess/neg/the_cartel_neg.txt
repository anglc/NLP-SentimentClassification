With its clunky chalkboard chapters and a parade of static talking heads too often repeating the filmmaker's underlying theme of political corruption and union myopia, it's a C theatrical experience. Maybe a C+ for right intentions.
The film -- for which Bowdon directed, wrote, narrated, produced, operated a camera, composed music and sang -- spends a little too much time on static shots of flickering computer screens filled with gray text, and it has the look of cheap video.
There are plenty of legitimate grievances here, but like Michael Moore at his pushiest, Bowdon often undermines his own argument with obvious factual cherry-picking.
Bowdon makes an insufferable first impression, and his movie often looks as if it were shot with a camera-phone (for good measure, he includes actual camera-phone footage, which admittedly looks worse than his).
Watching this film, you'd think that most public schools were Mafia-run slaughterhouses and most charter schools were urban academies with high success rates. Bowdon barely mentions the religiosity and profit motive behind some charter schools.
But this amateurish, ultimately poorly argued documentary isn't likely to convert many of those on the fence on this issue.
...you will more likely find yourself annoyed by this documentary's similarity to a series of television segments pasted together and stretched out to 90 minutes...
Anyone who gets a thrill out of town meetings may salivate at what Bowdon throws at viewers, which is all statistics and wonkery.
If it played on New Jersey TV, I bet The Cartel would open some eyes, but as Bowdon tries to parlay a very local issue into a nationally released movie, it's more likely to close them.
It makes no sense to approach a nationwide issue with such a limited focus.
The topic may be urgent, and the fallout heartbreaking, but this clumsy treatment barely passes.
