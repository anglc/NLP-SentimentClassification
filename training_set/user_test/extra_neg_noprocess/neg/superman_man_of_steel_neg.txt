Christliness has always been an element of the Superman myth. But this film's near literal insistence upon it becomes absurd since director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer don't dramatize the analogy, they presume it.
The movie consists of endless declamation, endless violence.
There's very little humor or joy in this Superman story.
Cavill broods handsomely as Superman, but this reboot skimps on fun and romance.
A robotic exercise in moviemaking that will no doubt satisfy the requirements of millions of distracted moviegoers who no longer require absolute engagement to be entertained-and who might, in fact, prefer exactly that.
A gritty, realistic story shot by a director whose instincts constantly push him away from grit and realism, and into flash and fantasy.
Like the man with a hammer to whom every problem looks like a nail, to Nolan and Goyer, every superhero universe apparently looks like Gotham City.
Action scenes shouldn't be dull, especially large-scale ones devastating half of a city, but that's exactly what threatens to happen here.
Action-filled but less than super: yet another summer blockbuster
No fun costume change in a phone booth, no wowing humans with his powers and no repartee with reporter Lois Lane.
A solid film, but a solid Superman?
