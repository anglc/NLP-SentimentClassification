None of this, unfortunately, is all that funny, although there's daffy charm to some moments.
The imaginary heroes never spring to life.
Unfunny mockumentary parodying Ken Burns' filmmaking.
Even though this overambitious mockumentary misses the mark, first-time writer/director Wendy Jo Cohen exhibits sufficient potential to make me curious about her next venture.
