Does the film pull back the curtain on who they are and what drives them? Not so much.
How much new does Venus and Serena have to tell us? Not enough.
The sisters themselves reveal a little, mostly because of Serena's unguarded imperiousness; but as a study of sports supercelebrity it's a tad subdued.
It might allow further appreciation of their accomplishments, but the one-sided approach too easily glosses over the more controversial aspects of their lives.
