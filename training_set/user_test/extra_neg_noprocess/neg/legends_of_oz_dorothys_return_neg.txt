Problems abound from the rushed beginning all the way through the impossibly resolved ending.
The bricks are still yellow, but the road doesn't lead anywhere special.
It's short on jokes and hampered by unmemorable musical numbers (including one about building a boat), and the film's niceness can't overcome the dopey tedium.
It's a little shocking how leaden the jokes are in this movie.
All in all, the beloved kingdom of Oz is not well served, though there's just enough detectable affection to keep it from feeling like a pure cashing-in.
Devoid of the visual magic and heartfelt emotion of the original film, this version of Oz and Dorothy 2.0 feel like the cheaply made knockoffs you find in a dollar store: garishly shiny, flimsy and not built to last.
Even by the standards of allowance-snatching half-term filler, this is pretty indifferent ...
A cynical cash-grab riding on the coat-tails of far better productions.
This film is very offbeat and psychedelic in that regard, though regrettably not nearly as accomplished or engaging as Alice in Wonderland which is loosely resembles.
A cheap and charmless reminder to leave the classics alone.
Carping on a film clearly targeted to 5-year-olds might seem unjust, but the filmmakers go about their business in such a lazy fashion that the viewer can't help but feel irritated by the whole ordeal.
Being an effective virtual babysitter isn't the same as being a satisfying entertainment.
Resting on the laurels of its namesake, Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return suffers from lackluster storytelling, TV-quality animation and haphazard music, all of which don't hold a candle to the many Oz tales that have come before it.
Wasting a voice cast populated with recognisable names, this attempt to cash in on nostalgia for its source material evokes more bewilderment and boredom than excitement or wistful reminiscence.
That it scored a few actual names [...] gives it the veneer of class, but it was designed to fool kids and their gullible parents, yet make everyone who sees it sad.
Oz has its moments, even to this day.
