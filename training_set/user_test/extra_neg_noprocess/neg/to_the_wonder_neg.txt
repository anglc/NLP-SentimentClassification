Love is a many-splendored thing, except when it isn't in To the Wonder, a wispy romantic movie about the death of a romance.
The movie plays like an undercooked pie that hasn't had enough time to cool and settle.
Essentially it's an agglomeration of Malick's worst stylistic annoyances.
A thing of great beauty, but not much more.
To the Wonder shouldn't be passed off as "self-parody," but as Malick's self-destructed misfire.
Terrence Malick's films have not been very accessible in the past. If this one is any indication, they are becoming less so. The narrative is thin, slow moving and ambiguous in places. It is moody, sombre and melancholy.
