As good as "The Motel Life" is for the actors, that's how bad it is for the viewer.
A pedestrian, undeveloped indie clunker, its failure as a complete, satisfying story especially disappointing since the sibling relationship at its center could have been special with a better script.
The whole thing is deep-down conservative and wetter than a Labrador's kiss.
The film is heavy-going, unformed and self-indulgent, with characters who are neither sympathetic nor (crucially) interesting.
As the protagonists wallow in melancholy and despair, they drag helpless moviegoers in with them.
Love and loyalty often carry the day. But love and loyalty are not carrying the day now.
More of an actors' showcase for Stephen Dorff and Emile Hirsch to get in some sharp practice than a cogent drama, "The Motel Life" is a warts-and-all indie effort that comes up short.
