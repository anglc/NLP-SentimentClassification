Along comes Marlon Wayans to do in A Haunted House what he once did in Scary Movie. And do it much, much worse.
A movie that offends every moral sensibility but delivers few comedic rewards.
Does it even qualify as a movie? Why did it take two people to write and cost $2.5 million to make?
You might chuckle at Wayans huddled in the tub, frantically trying to scrub himself clean of something slightly more earthly-freaky than evil spirits. But watching him get it on with stuffed animals? Ick.
There are vague hints that the story is "really" about the difficulties and anxiety of commitment, but then one of many variations on a fart joke distracts from any actual idea.
If the opening gag in your R-rated movie is an extended flatulence joke you should reconsider whether you're qualified to make such a movie.
Neither worthy of my laughter nor capable of inducing sleep. No, this is one of those rare films where its badness turns the cogs of your brain.
A Haunted House is technically inept, monotonous, and stiflingly cheap-looking. How this cost $2.5 million dollars to produce is beyond me.
Too banal to be offensive, it's certainly one to miss
Frustratingly, there's actually talent on-screen that hints at what could have been a cleverly comical take on the found-footage genre.
Heck, worse films starring Robert De Niro have been released this year.
Yet another spoof from Wayans and Alvarez, this movie isn't nearly as bad as it could have been (they also produced the resolutely unfunny Scary Movie 2 and Dance Flick).
There's just an odd recurrence of homophobic humor in the entire movie that compensates for lack of actual humor.
