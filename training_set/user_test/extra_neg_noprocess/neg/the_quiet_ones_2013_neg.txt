"The Quiet Ones" simply has nothing to say.
The Quiet Ones is a pretty ironic title for a horror film whose primary scare tactic is to periodically crank up the volume, sending the needle to the red with a sudden spike in the decibel levels.
Unfortunately, it's all very familiar and somewhat tediously played out.
The Quiet Ones is uninspired even by contemporary horror standards - which comes as a bit of a shock, given its pedigree.
With its many desperate attempts at scares and a completely lacking narrative, "The Quiet Ones" is a failure on just about every level.
Jared Harris would have fit in nicely alongside Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee back in Hammer's heyday.
Well-shot, well-acted and, well, kinda boring.
[Nearly] works as a horror-tinged chamber drama; when it is about spooky, underlit houses with inexplicable goings-on... it's merely adequate at best, and frequently not even that.
Doesn't actually tell a story or develop any kind of rising suspense or tingling chills so much as it presents a series of jump-shocks and sudden, loud noises.
The problem with the film comes from a tendency to not be able to deliver on its attempts at the Big Scares.
This latter-day product of renowned UK horror brand Hammer Films has all the finesse of a county-fair scarehouse, and it's about as scary.
If THE QUIET ONES is not a classic, at least it fails gracefully and the genre is better for its effort.
This lack of plausible narrative is either the result of lazy filmmaking or shortcut editing. Either way, you lose.
The film seems to mimic [Professor] Coupland's scientific method: Throw everything into the beaker, crank up the Bunsen burner, and hope the experiment works. In both cases, it doesn't.
Its retro melding of [The Conjuring and Insidious] with a heavy dose of Carrie-style telekinetic mayhem doesn't result in anything particularly memorable. Apart from the Slade, that is.
Campy and creepy - it's sinister but not scary enough.
