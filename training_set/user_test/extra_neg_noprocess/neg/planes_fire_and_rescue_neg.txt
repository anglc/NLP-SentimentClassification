Displaying a weird lack of memorable or endearing characters, this animated effort feels like a direct-to-video job from the 1990s.
It is, in almost all respects, a better movie. It's still not particularly good, though.
The meek action plays to the under-10 crowd, but the groaner puns will play only to masochists. Meanwhile, the 3-D ticket upcharge here is a big ripoff - the extra dimension is unnecessary.
The same lame puns wedged into a succession of situations, rather than a story.
Like Cars, this is essentially funny-animal animation with chrome and aluminium instead of fur.
This Disney cartoon is running on empty.
It's as if the Mouse House is providing bootlegs of its own material.
A solid voice cast (Harris, Holbrook et al) doesn't add much more than cosmetic touches to this bland animation.
The slender plot is very ordinary and the corny gags come thick and fast.
The kids will be satisfied with a thin slice of Pixar topped with Disney frosting, but there's nothing satisfying for the rest of us to chew on.
The target audience of under-10s has every right to feel patronised.
This story of heroism is second rate stuff that's unlikely to light your own fire.
This rotor movie's rote in places, too talky, and overstuffed with characters. Worst of all, one 'copter is a stereotypical Native; second-worst is Dipper, the main female character, a dippy, clingy, quasi-stalker type.
As with the first film, children will be drawn to the bright colours and simple morals, which makes some of the sexual and racial stereotyping on the sidelines rather regrettable.
It's not that there's less than meets the eye in Planes: Fire & Rescue, but rather that it is exactly what meets the eye: all surface, nothing more, nothing less.
