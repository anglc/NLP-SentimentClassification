This is a Southern "Downton Abbey," minus the loopy plot turns and wisecracks that make that series so addictive.
The film's tale ends up being less rich than its lovely Georgia settings.
"Savannah" should win some sort of award for most amount of times you'll ask, "They roped that guy into this turkey, too?"
The movie's story is limp, its romances are flightless and-despite the talented cast-its performances are toothless.
The story overflows with reverence but is drastically short on passion or suspense ...
The true story of Ward Allen, a man whose life was not interesting enough to be the basis for a film.
Despite some fine performances, the film has difficulty finding a consistent tone, and the well-intentioned script emphasizes melodrama and sentimentality.
Savannah's backstory may sound inscrutable to the world outside Southern Georgia social clubs; that's because it is.
A movie that's essentially only of local interest.
Savannah does attempt to tell the story of the friendship of those two accomplished men, but does so in a manner that is so astonishingly tone deaf, confused and narrowly focused...
A bit on the bland side, but as a plus, Jim Caviezel cracks his first on-screen smile in over a decade.
The film is impossible to take seriously as a commemoration of Moultrie's life or Allen's prolific status because of its plethora of contrivances.
