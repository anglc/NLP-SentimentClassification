Despite smatterings of wit and a stable of skilled performers, "C.O.G." struggles to find a consistent tone, its episodic structure veering from farcical to poignant to dangerously raw.
For Sedaris fans, "C.O.G." is a regrettably patronizing washout.
It feels deeply limited.
It's not necessarily the events Sedaris describes that make his essays enjoyable; it's the words he uses to describe them. Without his voice, the story falls flat.
I really wanted to like this film, being a fan of Sedaris' writing, of (screenwriter-director) Alvarez and of the great actors assembled here. Unfortunately, the screenplay lacks focus and is more often cruel than comedic.
Stale, flat and unprofitable might be how Shakespeare would have also described this uninvolving David Sedaris adaptation.
