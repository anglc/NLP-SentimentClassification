Ah, Bucharest. That exotic, Eastern European hotbed of romance, intrigue and hefty film-production tax breaks.
However you cut it, with all that talent, Charlie Countryman feels like a sad, wasted opportunity.
This catastrophe of a movie zigzags drunkenly between action-adventure and surreal comedy with some magical realism slopped over it like ketchup.
Even though you learn that Charlie is absolute aces at running from bad guys, the character pretty much remains a confusing, empty vessel. As does the movie.
A wildly unauthentic offering, that manages to take such raw, human emotions, and produce a picture that revels, frustratingly, in frivolity and irreverence.
As for Shia, he's wildly self-indulgent and narcissistic: all puppy eyes, emoting and angsting like there's no tomorrow. He just doesn't know when eneouf is eneouf.
The weird filmography of Shia LaBeouf, from Fury to Nymphomaniac via Transformers, continues with an ecstasy-fuelled excursion to eastern Europe in the bizarre The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman.
An eccentric, energetic muddle of a film that is badly overcooked by commercials director Fredrik Bond.
Shia LaBeouf continues his relentless campaign to prove himself the most tiresome person in the history of cinema, or showbusiness, or the universe.
There's quirky, and then there's straight-up annoying.
A tedious film; its death seems necessary, even merciful.
Mostly, this is empty, ugly and pretentious.
The ugly step-child of In Bruges with none of the class or wit, Charlie Countryman is truly terrible.
Trite indie-hipster exercise in blending romance, violence, and quirk.
Dropping acid must be far more entertaining than watching this pretentious mess ...
... an overwrought and muddled mess with little redemptive value.
There's no peaceful, affecting middle ground here, just a lot of noise, color, and empty feelings competing for attention, with little squeezing through the thick coating of artifice.
The haphazard use of magical realism and the ever-shifting thrust of the narrative makes the film wear out its welcome long before it's over.
