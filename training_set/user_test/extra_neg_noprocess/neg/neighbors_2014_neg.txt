It's Apatow without the Apatow, all ornaments and no tree.
It's gross, all right, but rarely funny -- unless jokes about alcohol-laced breast milk is your thing.
"Neighbors" may not be an all-out disaster, but it is an unfunny comedy that just can't find any jokes that really hit the mark. As a result, it's a rather dull film that wastes a potentially hilarious premise.
You either agree to partake in the beer pong of a plot before laying down your money or stay home.
Though Nicholas Stoller's shortest movie to date, Neighbors is as unfocused and undisciplined as anything within the director's seriously erratic filmography...
I'd love to see a movie with these two paired up again, one that doesn't rely on cruelty to garner laughs.
A grossout comedy that parties hard
Like a series of bad Saturday Night Live sketches, you keep hoping that the next bit will find the comedic mojo. Instead, one's funny bone remains unmoved.
The kind of movie where one is frequently told to park one's brain at the door. I have no doubt this would help, but even at the door, my brain would have raised objections.
Banal riffs on pop culture themes vie for laughs with depressing jokes about tits, balls and dicks. The low-point has Byrne (who I hope was well paid) being "milked" by Rogen. Whatever happened to comedy?
