There are moments in The Raid 2 that count among the best action set pieces in modern cinema. I just desperately wish they were in service of a better movie.
Arthouse martial-arts action that's incredibly dull even when it's being pornographic about its extreme bloody violence, and doesn't even bother with the nominally original one-location conceit of the first film.
Evans can't compete with more or less obvious influences like Oldboy and Infernal Affairs, but he's certainly no slouch in the sadism department, making his films in some ways exhilarating but also wearying, for better and worse.
Sadistic uber-violent mayhem - and the fact that it's subtitled doesn't much matter since the bloody, brutal brawling transcends the language barrier.
