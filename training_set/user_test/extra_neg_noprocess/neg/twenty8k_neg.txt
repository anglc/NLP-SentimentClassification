The film's ensemble cast is an impressive mix of old hands and fresh faces, but their efforts are let down by some very contrived plotting.
The pacey but formulaic action rapidly loses credibility.
Badly let down by some silly plotting that negates the film's ability to be taken seriously and a screenplay that all too often reduces a lot of the characters to stereotype.
One expected more from a script co-written by Paul Abbott.
