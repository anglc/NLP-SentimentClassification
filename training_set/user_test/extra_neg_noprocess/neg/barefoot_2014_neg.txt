The gradual revelation that there's more to Daisy than meets the eye is no great surprise, but it does at least negate - too late! - some of the more troubling subtext.
He's a rebellious trust-funder who specializes in strip clubs, one-night stands and gambling debts. She's a possibly schizophrenic mental patient raised in near-captivity by an abusive mother. How could these two kids not fall in love?
Really, the emotionally ill have enough stigmas to contend with. They don't need the patronizing-yet-popular movie one of "They're just like us - only, you know, more innocent."
A sorry throwback to sentimental 1960s movies -- the ones in which an offbeat woman repairs the soul of an emotionally clueless man.
The movie acts like screwball comedy, but there are no laughs as Daisy and Jay's connection lurches toward implausible romance.
There was once a time when director Andrew Fleming made fantastic films.
A soggy mess, one that takes a thoroughly simplistic look at mental illness and the people who suffer from it, delivering instead a romance and a road trip that are entirely unrealistic.
Ultimately, Daisy is revealed to be sane, but she's still emotionally and socially stunted [...] and the romantic relationship that gradually blossoms between her and Jay feels disturbingly pedophilic.
It's an amalgam of tried-and-true themes minus any originality.
Scott Speedman and Evan Rachel Wood would have been better off doing a YouTube video together where they simply make goo-goo eyes at one another than co-starring in a featherweight trifle like "Barefoot".
[Barefoot], constructed of shards of other movies and a surfeit of bad ideas, is lacking in originality and positively perspires in its flailingly failed attempt to deliver quirky entertainment.
"Benny & Joon" meets "Rainman."
