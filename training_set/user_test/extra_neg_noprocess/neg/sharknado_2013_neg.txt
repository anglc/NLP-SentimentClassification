Like other midnight specials, Sharknado is made for mockery, but it lacks the sincerity that have made The Room and Birdemic: Shock and Terror, so richly laughable.
Sharknado was born to suck, but I'm hesitant to accuse its enthusiastic viewers of being rubes. The prime reason: I'm an enthusiastic viewer of it too.
Is this really any sillier than an entire town trapped under a mysterious invisible dome? OK, I suppose it is.
