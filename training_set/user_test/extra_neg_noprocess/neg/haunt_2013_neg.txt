By the time the final act unleashes its revelations and peril, "Haunt" has felt more like an exercise in formal spookiness than a full-blooded story of lingering malevolence.
There's lots of mixed film stock and screeches on the soundtrack (as in the credits for "Seven"), but this gets annoying, as do the predictable twists.
There is virtually nothing in Mac Carter's horror flick that deviates from the standard haunted house plot (or, in this case, plod).
I've had bigger scares from the windows at FAO Schwarz.
The frustration here comes from the filmmakers' inability to present characters with dimension, so that we might come to identify with them and their fears.
Given a better script -- or at least, one that was a little more self-aware -- Haunt could have been a solid scare.
A humdrum, even irritating slog that, safe to say, won't be giving anyone a sleepless night.
Mac Carter repeatedly compromises his intuitive, and often elegantly framed, glances at his main characters' teenage blues by too busily going through amateur-night gesticulations of spooking his audience.
