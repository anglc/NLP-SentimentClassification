There's something flimsy and unformed at these characters' cores, something that no amount of jumpy close-ups, skittering sideways glances, and rainy music can make up for.
A breathy tale of a not-quite love affair, Drake Doremus' "Breathe In" is yet another skillfully acted indie drama that's never quite good enough to be memorable.
The film needs more help than it gets from the script, which turns on facile coincidence and dwindles in originality as it moves toward its climax.
[Doremus] telegraphs the film's intentions early and builds at a ponderous, self-important pace toward a trite, unsatisfying finish.
Jones, outstanding as the other woman in Fiennes's "The Invisible Woman," seems adrift here and Ryan's Megan projects no desires past maintaining the status quo.
A film about a May-December romance, it would be laborious to sit through at any time of year.
Fine performances barely make up for this melodrama's narrative bankruptcy.
It does everything it should, except take your breath away.
Enough with the dramas about frustrated older men seeking a second chance at life and love through a barely legal girl. Please.
