Essentially a Monday Night Raw episode with mythological dressing.
The dialogue isn't dubbed, but is written and delivered so indifferently that it might as well have been.
[Other "Hercules" movies] at least nodded at classical mythology. Harlin's boasts a Hercules in name chiefly and banks on moviegoers' ignorance.
The Legend of Hercules may not track, but Harlin still knows how to set up a rousing circus.
The whole thing is a total bore.
Lunkhead Kellan Lutz is the demigod's density in Renny Harlin's 300-lite, MST3K-ready retelling of the classical legend. Think Jesus with muscles, by the power of Greyskull.
There's nothing here to engage the viewer or make them care one iota about what's occurring on the screen, making it no wonder that this got dumped into theaters in the middle of January.
The film opens on a huge battle in the Greek city of Argos, but it often ends up feeling like the director bought it cheap at the high street namesake.
Even dental extraction is more enjoyable to endure than this artistically bankrupt misfire.
No one seems to have high hopes for it - though it might well help to pass a wet afternoon when it shows up on Netflix 15 minutes from now.
This lousy attempt at a revival isn't even good for camp laughs.
The lore of Hercules has spanned centuries, yet it's unlikely to ever see a more generic treatment on film than that of Renny Harlin's overblown origin story.
Somehow more cartoonish than Disney's version, which actually was a cartoon.
A low point is when Hercules kills the Nemean lion, who seemed to be minding his own business in his forest; not cool, Herc, even if he was all digital and as fakey as those stuffed cats they used to throw at Steve Reeves.
A misfire from top to bottom so complete that even when you think you have a handle on all the ways it can be bad, it pulls out another one that's even worse.
Mythical tale is violent and poorly executed.
This origin story of the great hero Hercules (Lutz) of Greek mythology lacks even one semi-decent action piece.
Boldly unimaginative and ferociously derivative
When awfulness reaches a certain point, it achieves unintentional hilarity.
Tepid and tedious with acting so ludicrous that it's laughable.
Through the centuries, the legend of Hercules has survived. It will survive the splat of this big B.C. cheese ball, too.
Harlin's '90s heyday of crafting fun fare becomes that much more of a distant memory.
The best that can be said of this latest take on Hercules is that it is over fast,.
