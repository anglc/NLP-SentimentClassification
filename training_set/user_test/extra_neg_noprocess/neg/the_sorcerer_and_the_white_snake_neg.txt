These showdowns feature spectacular, Lord of the Rings-style CGI settings, but not much in the way of thrills or terror.
The clunky action mostly revolves around uninspired wire-fu choreography: Monks fly around while flailing their arms as hordes of CGI creatures gather around and then do nothing.
A silly, derivative supernatural-action extravaganza that would have been better at a fraction of its f/x budget.
This hyperactive assault on the senses from Hong Kong is noteworthy only for its dazzling array of computer-generated special effects.
We've seen this movie before, in better clothes and with a much higher IQ.
The film looks so glossy, plasticized, and unreal that all you end up thinking about is special effects.
An amusing Chinese martial arts reminder that not all cheese comes from Switzerland, or Wisconsin.
It's a sometimes charming film from the veteran action filmmaker, but remains a curiosity, lacking comic sharpness and romantic intensity.
There's hardly any love affair left really because the CGI has taken over with a vengeance. I got a bit bored by this, because it's just special effects, just CGI all the way through and the story is just shunted aside.
The director has pulled out all stops to impress, perhaps a bit too excessively, so that the fragile emotions of this love affair are undermined.
With the mushometer maxed out, and a score that starts on overdrive and heads for overbearing, this ridiculously melodramatic tale of forbidden love tries to bury its narrative flaws with a colourful coating of CGI - but ends up a shiny glutinous mess.
