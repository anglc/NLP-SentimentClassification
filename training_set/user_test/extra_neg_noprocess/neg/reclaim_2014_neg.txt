In any movie where good people are being scammed by nefarious ripoff artists, there's the potential moment where the protagonists become so stupid and trusting that you lose all sympathy for them. That moment occurs about midway through Reclaim
Alan White's polished but pedestrian pic mines little real suspense and few surprises from a formulaic script.
Carmine Gaeta and Luke Davies' screenplay is constructed from plot mechanics, and the emotional stakes grow less convincing with every twist of the screw.
A message before the closing credits cites the widespread incidence of child trafficking, but any social import is lost. This isn't activism; it's by-the-numbers suspense.
There are no twists or even surprises, except the final realization that director Alan White is taking his culturally clueless, ineptly shot B-movie totally seriously.
While we can all agree that human trafficking is a despicable thing, it's also clear that this amazingly inept screenplay fails to do the issue justice.
Reclaim isn't a disaster, it's just disappointing and thoughtless after a potent introduction.
Once the sides are firmly established, Reclaim dutifully goes through the subpar-thriller motions.
Reclaim's highly mechanized plot ensures that the film is over before it even ends.
