Writer-director-star Luke Moran's drama about Abu Ghraib is an ambitious if not particularly revealing debut.
A halfhearted attempt at truly getting inside these men's and women's heads to make sense of their actions, which is ostensibly the purpose of dramatizing such a recent and shameful ordeal.
The film hardly scratches Abu Ghraib's surface.
Its tendency to water down the realities of Abu Ghraib trivializes its subject instead of providing depth or context.
"Boys of Abu Ghraib" has a few, brief insights into how boredom, anger, and frustration helped fuel the rage that led to torture but the film couches it all in the filmmaking of TV-movie melodrama, draining it of all potential power or social context.
It's a shame the picture ends on its knees when it had to the potential to create a certain viewpoint that could invite an understanding of the Abu Ghraib prison environment and the stress placed on all involved parties.
For a film about the hardened soldiers who oversaw the most notorious detainment center of the Iraq War, Boys Of Abu Ghraib is remarkably squeamish about tackling its subject matter head-on.
