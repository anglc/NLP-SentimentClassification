A Lifetime movie, minus the commercials, but with every predictable twist and turn and treacly message intact. She shoots. It bores.
Lifetime movies have their pleasures, and so does this film.
[A] strained and soapy empowerment comedy ...
Even though it earns an R rating for profanity and some risque material, it's too meek and mild-mannered to qualify as brave, or even slyly subversive.
unlikely to put Susan Seidelman back in the front ranks of Hollywood, even though it is an enjoyable, albeit highly derivative, comedy that dares to put "women of a certain age" front and center.
It's heart is in the right place, but -- with poor writing, lame humor and dreadful on-court sequences -- that's one of the only things right about it.
By and large this is a film meant to do exactly what the film's charity event does: to provide light entertainment while raising money for a good cause.
Abundant good intentions help to soften the predictably mild impact of this broad female-empowerment comedy.
Older women may still have game, but comedy drops the ball.
