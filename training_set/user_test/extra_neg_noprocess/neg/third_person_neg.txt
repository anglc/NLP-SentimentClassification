"Third Person" is such a solipsistic, navel-gazing creation that it seems to have barely made it out of Haggis' mind and onto the screen.
It's all, I'm sorry to say, a melodramatic slog.
"Third Person" doesn't lack for ambition, and it's nice to see Neeson in the kind of role that he excelled at before he morphed into an action star. But the film may have some folks wishing they'd bought a ticket to "Transformers 4" instead.
Trust is essential to any love relationship, writer-director Paul Haggis wants us to know, though he trusts us so little to grasp this theme ourselves that he makes his alter ego here, a world-weary novelist played by Liam Neeson, spell it out.
When we reach our finale you can't help but feel somewhat detached and uninvolved in this title.
Third Person suffers from a script that fails to hook you in during its opening section and drags on without sufficient emotional connection for 137 minutes.
[A] multi-stranded slice of phoney-baloney, manipulative claptrap.
This handsome looking film feels old-fashioned and stodgy.
What is it with Paul Haggis? Has he forgotten how to tell a simple story?
What does it all mean? Not very much, I suspect, with the cast sombrely delivering lines about trust and frailty while starring broodily into the middle distance.
The larger edifice feels distinctly jerry-built and, sure enough, when nudged sharply in the final scenes it comes crashing disastrously about the director's ears.
By the closing credits you too will share the characters' grief, solemnly mourning 137 minutes you'll never get back. Insufferable.
Unsurprisingly, the stores come together in a hurried final stretch...but you really rather wish they'd never started.
It's a deeply dubious luxury-tourist fantasy about parallel lives in various foreign hotel rooms, and it shows a very strange need to punish and humiliate its female characters.
An interminable illusive boondoggle with clunky turns and a flat, uninspiring reveal.
It's couture misery: dress by Valentino, watch by Breitling, lingering sexual regrets model's own.
If Crash set your teeth on edge, book in at the dentist's before seeing this one.
Avoid at all costs.
As taken as I was with the first three quarters of the movie, by the end I felt like throwing something at the screen. Or rather, at the tiny man behind the screen: Haggis, the great and terrible.
'Third Person' takes place in New York, Paris and Rome, but what it offers moviegoers is a trip to Dullsville.
