For dramatic verve and emotional nuance, apes trounce people, hands down, and the movie suffers badly from the mismatch; all traces of finesse are trampled by the bombast of the climax.
For all its high-end special effects and its Shakespearean ambitions, Dawn fumbles its emotional moments and forces its action.
It's a thoroughly mediocre movie [and] I'm sorry to say that, considering that its predecessor in this new cycle, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, was so unexpectedly good.
