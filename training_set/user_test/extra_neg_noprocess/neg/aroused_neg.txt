Too many times, "Aroused" arouses curiosity without really satisfying it.
It has an inviting softness, but the background music, odd camera angles, close-ups and lingering shots only distract and objectify.
For a film that purports to go beyond the surface and uncover the "true essence" of adult film stars, "Aroused" spends a lot of time admiring the surface.
Director Deborah Anderson ... turns a welcome opportunity into a shameless example of exploitation and self-promotion.
Aspires to be a consciousness-raising documentary but is only as deep as a tube of lipstick ...
By imagining that she's pulling back the curtain, Anderson is instead making porn even more inscrutable, even more difficult to understand...this doesn't seem to be a main concern, as these actresses roll lie in bed for a voyeuristic camera...
Leaves you undernourished both intellectually and emotionally.
Faux feminist quotes ridiculously compare the porn stars to Anais Nin, Joan of Arc and yes, Eleanor Roosevelt. As Anderson cheers them while they get gussied up for oral, anal and mock rape scenes, exposing their souls way less than flashing flesh.
It's tough not to wish Anderson, who fortunately moves away from initial, obvious statements about how sex sells, tried harder to get the full story.
