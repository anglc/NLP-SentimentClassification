The latest installment of the slick, highly profitable parody franchise.
It's supposed to be funny, but you'd have an easier time reading a zombie's pulse than you would finding a single good laugh ...
For the art-house crowd, who may, I suppose, stumble drunk into the wrong theater after too much Chardonnay, there are nods to Black Swan and 127 Hours.
A film composed almost entirely of jokes that were much funnier when you read them on Twitter years ago.
Like so much of this whole series, the mere mention of a familiar pop culture figure or title is supposed to be hilarious.
Scary Movie 5 must be some kind of psychological experiment. Perhaps the filmmakers sat in a lab, rubbing their temples while wondering aloud how awful they could make a movie and still score at the box office.
The writers are on auto pilot once more, relying on the "It's familiar, so it must be funny" routine...
Scary Movie 5 is a reprehensible excuse of a comedy and should barely be considered a film since it's of such poor quality. They don't make a dunce cap big enough for individuals this idiotic.
Railing against Scary Movie V for diminishing the series' standards would be as effective as criticising Brooke Hogan for disgracing her proud family name. And yet, the fifth instalment of the Scary Movie franchise does do that.
A boldly uninspired torrent of halfhearted slapstick, interminable poop jokes, and pointless pop-culture references, a veritable tsunami of idiocy.
Enough. Please.
This is a big waste of time, drawing one more gasp out of a series that should have given up the ghost long ago.
This franchise has steadily gotten worse and worse with #5 being the all time low.
The only thing scary about 'Scary Movie 5' is the thought of a sequel.
It's crude, gross and probably wishes it was offensive but comes across as just lazy, limp and unfunny.
Don't. Don't go see this. Don't subject yourself to this. Don't subject your brain to this. Don't give these people your money and encourage them to make more of this.
The filmmakers border on sophomoric desperation, achieving a measurable shred of humor only in the outtakes during the closing credits.
A laughter vacuum whose race to parody the likes of Mama and the new Evil Dead remake didn't stretch to writing actual jokes.
This vapid, vulgar insult to the intelligence couldn't possibly have been tested on any focus groups. Can we all now agree that we've reached the cinematic saturation point with the rapidly-expiring, Scary Movie franchise?
If I ever have to watch another Scary Movie film, I'll give up on writing, cinema, and society forever.
The scariest thing about Scary Movie 5 is that it actually made me chortle less than some of the silly horror flicks it's trying to spoof!
Lacking a single honest laugh, this is shoddy by comparison with the other Scary Movie sequels... which throws it in a pit with Transylmania, Breaking Wind and Stan Helsing.
