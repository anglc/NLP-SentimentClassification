A hillbilly grindhouse yawp of a movie that belches in your face and leaves a sour stink.
It gets pretty tiring watching decent actors indulge in such broad and unfunny caricatures.
Nearly two decades after its release, "Pulp Fiction" is still inspiring imitators.
A fine cast is wasted in this lurid, grindhouse-style effort that strains for both laughs and shocks.
These stories collectively amount to little more than a portrait of rural life as a redneck nightmare wherein people are very stupid or very evil.
The type of third-rate Quentin Tarantino crime saga that lost its luster in the late '90s ...
The problem with "Pawn Shop Chronicles" is not the fact that it is a clone of "Pulp Fiction." The problem is that it is a lousy clone.
The freewheeling script strains to be edgy while most of its jokes fall flat.
Pawn Shop Chronicles' stylistic flourishes, used so judiciously in The Cooler are heavy-handed here and, with the possible exception of when the picture squints into anamorphic, just not that clever.
A meandering and in some ways oddly memorable anthology of sweat-soaked lunacy, Pawn Shop Chronicles lurches to and fro, lacking a dynamic narrative throughline.
A dumb, boring and unfunny mess.
Pawn Shop Chronicles goes from curious to overkill in a hurry, cementing the director's reputation as a fire hose of a filmmaker, perhaps biologically incapable of subtlety.
There's an alternate reality somewhere, wherein Pawn Shop Chronicles is not released in theaters on July 12th, but instead is projected on the wall of a small, narrow hallway in Comic-Con, never to be heard from again.
By the time it winds to a conclusion, the film seems to have tired itself out, like a toddler who screeches nonsensically for hours, then falls asleep in a fetal ball in the corner.
Gonzo, hyper-violent, sometimes amusing. But a redneck 'Pulp Fiction' ought to be funnier than this.
