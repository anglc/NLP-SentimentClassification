Godzilla handles everything the military hurls at him: ships, guns, planes, rockets, even a squadron of HALO paratroopers. The only thing that can cut him down to size is being relegated to a supporting role in his very own movie.
The beasts just want to have fun, but the gravest letdown in Edwards's film is that, most of the time, he fends off the chance to have fun himself.
It's a tad better than the 1998 Godzilla, perhaps, but that's not saying much.
This reboot, for some un-godzilla-y reason, doesn't want to admit it's a creature-feature B-movie. Serious actors seriously try to make their running-down-a-corridor or obsession-with-a-contaminated-site or stares-at-a-monster very dramatic and believable
Cranston is our true hero, Godzilla our anti-hero, and they get the bum's rush in favor of flat depictions of other characters and creatures we've seen so many times before...
It has wonderful visuals and some terrific beats, yet has little-to-no story with woefully thin and passive characters.
While there's not much genuine tension along the way, the film manages a few clever twists within its mainstream framework that allow it to escape some of the pointless pitfalls of many other remakes.
Sure, there's something to be said for teasing an audience... ratcheting up anticipation of what's eventually to come. But at some juncture - much earlier than director Gareth Edwards intends - Godzilla needs to stop being an extra in his own movie.
