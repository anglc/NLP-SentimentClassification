Confused plot, accents difficult to understand.
Whatever impact the film gains from its startling subject is all but dissipated ...
Paddy Considine's benumbed ambiguity at least works against writer-director Shan Khan's reduction of honor killings to grist for the cheapest of pulpy thrills.
A whole lotta violent bigoted men discussing women's lives as if they merit any say in the matter. If only pop culture were as concerned with women's stories as it is with men's.
We don't leave the cinema feeling like we've just sat through a truly accomplished piece of cinema, and unfortunately, in this instance, that's what matters most.
There's such an important issue at the centre of this British thriller that the film should not be ignored, even if filmmaker Shan Khan strains to turn it into a formulaic thriller.
The film itself never quite comes into focus.
It's an eye-catching premise, though first-time director/writer Shan Khan lacks the rigour or panache to do it justice.
An interesting premise but stodgy, suspense-free execution.
An intermittently worthy attempt by writer-director Shan Khan to address a highly emotive subject.
It's hard to work out for whom this semi-interesting hot mess was intended.
