Syrup is an unsatisfying blend of romantic comedy and scathing social satire, slamming the high-stakes games of product marketing and sales.
The actors are young and beautiful, the soundtrack kicks and the camera zips around with precision. But the script never seems to match the carefully orchestrated mood.
The story works hard for winking relevance. But this dark lark is like walking around Times Square looking at the flashy logos and lights and thinking you see the message behind the medium.
A great performance from Amber Heard can't save Syrup from its half-baked, sluggish script and obnoxious complacency.
It's a spunky film, but only in frustrating fits, with the majority of the feature overly concerned with its appearance, generating a sliver of irony to go with all the mediocrity.
Syrup imagines itself to be bolder and funnier than it actually is.
