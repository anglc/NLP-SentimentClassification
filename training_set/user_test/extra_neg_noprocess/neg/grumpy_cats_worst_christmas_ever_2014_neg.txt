Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever could use a whole lot more of Plaza's ad-libbed derision for the entire project and the suckers who find themselves watching it. The claws do come out, but the scratches just aren't deep enough.
There's a plot, which any of us could have written in our sleep.
The best way to describe the film as a whole would be if Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure, Home Alone, Garfield, icanhascheezburger, product placement, commercial breaks, outdated cultural references, suburban community theater, and acid had a baby.
[It] has some funny lines from Plaza while occasionally inserting Grumpy Cat into ridiculous situations, but is mostly trying to do what it can within the limitations of its budget, its network and its leading feline.
Grumpy Cat's thriving merchandise line is the obvious motivation behind this otherwise forgettable movie.
One can't help but wish all this meta commentary had been grafted onto a better story and a better movie that didn't feel like such a cheap rush job.
A cross between a crass piece of holiday marketing and the kind of thing that might air on Adult Swim in the middle of the night.
