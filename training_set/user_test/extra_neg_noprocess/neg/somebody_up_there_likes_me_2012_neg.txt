The time-killing universe Byington has created makes sure we never forget how absurd he thinks the whole movie is. Fun for him, perhaps.
This isn't mumblecore, but it isn't slapstick, either. File under mumblestick, perhaps?
The film never quite comes together enough to get over the sense that it's a comedy made by people who think they're too cool to laugh but it comes close.
There's talent here, but the goal seems to be proving that everyone involved is too cool to make an actual movie.
