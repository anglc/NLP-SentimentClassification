The film's downbeat switchback ending is neither convincing nor earned.
While lead actress Rosie Day turns in a phenomenal performance, The Seasoning House is more bite than bark, creating an uneven and empty watch.
The whole thing is laugh-out-loud dumb.
Hyett earned his reputation as a prosthetics wiz on films like The Descent and The Woman in Black; the human monsters he gives us here might as well be made out of cardboard.
It's cleverly made on a small budget, but is so over-designed and carefully structured that we never believe it.
If only the dialogue and camera work were as good as the make-up effects.
A soulless horror thriller that fails to captivate thanks to a poor script and some terribly unconvincing performances from certain cast members.
This is a deeply unpleasant subject matter and Hyett's handling of it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth.
A horror film of two halves: the first squalid and hard to stomach, the second surreal and hard to take seriously.
The Seasoning House may ultimately feel as compromised and tainted as its heroine - but Hyett remains a rising talent to watch, especially if he can find a better script to match his uneasy vision and moody production design.
Though The Seasoning House is far from a great film - both slow and occasionally harbouring ill logic - it is an enticing calling card for its director.
