Alt horror about a Seattle surgery drop-out is a mediocre specimen of the Canadian kinky flesh genre of "Antiviral," "Crash" and "Kissed." End credits say "For Eli Roth."
Writer-director siblings Jen and Sylvia Soska allow their film to turn slack and unfocused after an enticingly lurid, wickedly tense first half.
A sensational opening makes the disappointing final act hurt all the more as American Mary falls in a heap in its final act.
The almost excessively uneven narrative does, in the end, cancel out the effectiveness of the film's positive attributes...
Creepy, perverted, disgusting fright flick filled with horrific imagery.
A mindless exercise in sadism that's neither scary nor a guilty pleasure.
Try as the sisters might, American Mary is neither scary or funny.
Given its many failings, nothing short of an extreme makeover could save American Mary. Scalpel, please.
American Mary simply reveals itself as a film with little on its mind, content to scare rubberneckers into contemplating the backstory of the more outlandish body manipulation jobs they've seen in public. A documentary would have sufficed.
