"Kiss of the Damned" tries to give the vampire movie something it most definitely does not need: class.
We need our storytellers to do more than draw painfully obvious parallels between drinking blood and making love.
The screenplay is cliched and simplistic melodrama that drags even if the images and some of the operatic music quotes are lush.
Though high-brow, erotic and smart, the retro vampire pic lays an egg because its mostly foreign cast screws up the mood piece with uniformly wooden performances.
Just about any episode of True Blood is sexier, more entertaining and thought-provoking than Kiss of the Damned.
Bloody awful.
