Thanks to the muddled plot motivations Tower Block really struggles in the final third.
Contains some effective jolts and engaging characters. But after setting up the premise, it doesn't really have anywhere to go. Kind of like the characters themselves
The film is efficiently made and more realist than some of its ilk, in that the desperate inhabitants seem credible. What it lacks is directorial flair.
Tower Block doesn't rise high enough to match its ambitions.
It's not a bad idea for a movie, but what we get is undercooked, with poor logic and even poorer pacing conspiring to prevent any much-needed tension to build.
"Guilty pleasure" is pushing it, but you might develop a certain guilty appreciation for the way this slab of breezeblock Brit-schlock goes about its ludicrously contrived business.
