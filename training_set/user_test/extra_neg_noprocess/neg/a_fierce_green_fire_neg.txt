Kitchell plods through this worthy material.
It's a decent overview of the subject, but the film's presentation is unexceptional, and it never hints that there is reasoned opposition to the views it advocates.
About as sleepy as a documentary can be.
There's no consistent narrative thread to carry the film from start to finish, and A Fierce Green Fire fails to open any singular intellectual or psychological point of investigation.
