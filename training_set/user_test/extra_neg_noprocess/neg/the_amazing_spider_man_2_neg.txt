Despite the efforts of Electro, the franchise is running shockingly low on juice.
About the best thing one can say about this fiasco is that Webb has taken only two films to reach the same exhausted, exhausting endpoint that Raimi required three to achieve. It's progress, of a sort.
This is a movie that needs to remove a piece of jewelry.
The trouble with director Marc Webb's disappointing sequel is it wants to have it both ways: to take seriously human connection and loss and also spin the spectacular and pulpy... Spider-Man 2 never locates that sweet spot.
The studios and the producers have to split the difference -- between excellence and adequacy, between darkness and light, between seriousness and fun. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 might have been split too far. It doesn't taste like anything.
I think I'll pass on The Amazing Spider-Man 3.
Okay, I don't want to hang the failure of this mega-budget sequel on a single actor. It truly was a team effort. But, Garfield looks most unattractive as the webbed wonder.
... pales in comparison to its predecessor as it emphasizes spectacle more than story.
Another lesson on why introducing too many villains dilutes the richness of detail available when focusing on one. A delightful reboot diminished in its second act.
It's like they took one good and one bad script and mashed them together... proof that the box office has become all about the franchise...
Andrew Garfield is note-perfect, and the chemistry he shares with Emma Stone is reason enough to watch, but The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is too cartoony and childish for its own good. A disappointing backwards step for the series.
Despite the number of villains and conspiracies at work in the screenplay, they actually aren't what makes this film overlong and wearying. A leaner script and/or more judicious editing re: (Peter & Gwen's) relationship would have made a better movie.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2 throws everything at the wall to see what sticks, but most of it just goes "splat." It is an exhausting experience, and one that feels far less than amazing.
While there is much to enjoy in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, it is also hard not to feel like it is working primarily as yet another set-up, building the foundation for future films at the expense of the central narrative
With the studio seemingly more interested in mini-Marvel-esque universe building than basic storytelling, I'll be bracing myself for another underwhelming, rather than amazing, Spider-Man.
"It's as if the lessons that were learned by the widely loathed, 2007 'three-quel' Spider-Man 3 were lost on the filmmakers and studio, who are condemned to repeat those mistakes of the past."
Even the most stylized genre movie needs the occasional infusion of real-person behavior.
If you're a teen, the effort to jam in so many storylines and action will fulfill you to the max, while asking too much of less forgiving audiences in the age-stretching and sensory overload.
What corporate accounting looks like in cinematic form.
