The crappiest chiller in recent memory, quite literally.
Former wrestler Maillet is the only performer who generates any empathy.
It's a grotesque, deadly dull piece of cinematic upchuck, a horror film minus tension or chills. Think "The Toxic Avenger," minus the avenger.

While Septic Man might sound on paper like a little gem that Troma might have made, it is rather slow moving fare with much rambling around in dark sewers calling out for aid rather than traditional horror fare.
A big, messy, arbitrary handful of stupidity and grossness, lacking any sort of unifying gonzo aesthetic or queasy moodiness.
The yuck factor challenges your gag reflex at every turn.
