So 66 years after Robinson became the first black major league baseball player, here we are with 42, which has been made with such reverence for Robinson's importance that Robinson is barely there.
42 is a hackneyed, cookie-cutter film that manages to tell us absolutely nothing about a turning point in American history.
The film certainly feels both well-meaning and well-intentioned, but 42 can't quite find a suitable tone or flow, fluctuating between quiet moments that convey tremendous emotion and over-the-top, hammy, stagey, and exposition-heavy sequences.
I wanted to kick Ford/Rickey into next Christmas, and you can add the movie. Its corny triumphalism is barely bearable.
