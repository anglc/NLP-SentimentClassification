An erotic thriller with too many twists and back stories to count.
[Zima] saves some of this plodding thriller - a police investigation alone seems to go on forever - but not enough to make the steaminess pay off.
What remains is a bland, perfunctory erotic thriller that lacks the courage of its would-be-trashy convictions ...
It woefully lacks subtlety and suspense, and its characters aren't the least bit sympathetic.
Babbitt loves her actors and gives them fun stuff to do. If she works with similar themes in the future, I hope she gives her performers and her clearly fertile imagination more room to play.
This "Shadow of a Doubt" riff is a bisexual Hitchcock teaser.
Babbit's poky pacing ... doesn't do either star any favors, and anyone tempted to watch for prurient reasons should know the film is more basic-cable-at-10 p.m. sexy than after-midnight-on-Showtime sexy.
At the center of Breaking the Girls, festering like an open sore, is the stereotype of the psycho lesbian bitch.
