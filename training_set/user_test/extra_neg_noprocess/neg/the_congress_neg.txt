The anger drains out of the picture, and we watch in a state of passive appreciation and indifference.
It's almost painful to watch the immense promise of "The Congress," Ari Folman's spectacularly ambitious experiment, dissipate into nothing.
Folman makes one phantasmagorical leap after another, adding a live-action coda, but the visual freedom doesn't expand the story, it abandons it.
It's an intensely frustrating film, one that veers between excellent and silly in the space of seconds.
With more disciplined writing and editing, Folman's cartoon menagerie could have resembled a masterpiece. As it stands, it's an admirable and thought-provoking failure.
It boasts big ideas that it wants us to mull over, but Folman's labyrinthine film doesn't so much discuss them in any cohesive way as much as it just points them out.
