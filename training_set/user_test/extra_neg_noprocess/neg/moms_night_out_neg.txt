If the concept of a moms' night out is premised on the notion that mothers can never get away for fear their families will collapse in their absence, then this movie cruelly confirms that fear.
What ensues is frenetic and never as funny as it should be because directing brothers Andrew and Jon Erwin are not skilled enough at pacing the action and varying the volume.
Basically, the moral of the story is: Don't go out. Because if you do, all hell will break loose - or rather, all heck.
Seldom has wackiness been as tedious as it is in "Moms' Night Out," a Christian-themed film that is desperate to make adherents seem wild and crazy but mostly makes them seem incapable of raising children.
It's rare that a movie fails on absolutely every level, but "Moms' Night Out" is a remarkably vivid example.

A beautiful, touching, truthful idea that deserves so much better than this generally obnoxious, unfunny movie.
They aren't caricatures, per se, but in the behavior-reinforcing fashion of simple sitcom, we see an unflattering portrait of brittle, hostile, hustling, neurotic modern suburban control freaks. Who ought to listen to their man, and the Father.
Ugly sexism in what's trying to be a harmless feature, pandering to the female audience with a mean-spirited attitude toward men and their habitual boobery.
Moms' Night Out is purposefully un-hip, but that doesn't keep it from trying to keep up with the times in ways that are so painfully, unconvincingly of the moment that they already feel dated.
The big problem is that none of the moms are interesting.
