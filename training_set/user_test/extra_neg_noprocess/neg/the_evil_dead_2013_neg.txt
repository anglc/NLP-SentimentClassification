Despite much old-school splatter, it's seldom frightening and oddly unfunny.
Five years from now, will you want to watch this bloody $14 million extravaganza or Raimi's shoestring original, which was Amateur Hour elevated to pop art? Evil Dead just bleeds money.
A gore fest that's just effective enough to whet fans' appetite for a sequel, even as it kills everyone else's appetite for dinner.
Maybe I am just getting too old for this stuff.
Evil Dead owes everything to its predecessor, and [director Fede] Alvarez never tries to hide that fact, even when his movie feels painfully redundant.
The filmmakers behind this Evil Dead remake have completely missed what made Sam Raimi's original film work so well, opting instead for a typical horror bloodbath that fails to differentiate itself.
... strips away the tongue-in-cheek satire of its predecessor and settles for modern genre pandering aimed at fans of death, dismemberment, and unbelievable amounts of gore.
Fernandez's film falls most flat, as Raimi's Dead pics are full of comedy, whether Three-Stooges-indebted or just plain black and gross-out, while this rethink is monotonously serious - and really a bit evilly dull at times.
I will always appreciate a horror flick that introduces novel and inventive ways to dispatch of its cast. But the frights are almost totally absent. So what are we even doing here?
If Hollywood is having trouble with deciding who its 'war and terror' enemies are, that's nothing compared with its crisis in horror.
All the requisite blood and gits but not much else to offer by way of entertainment.
