The movie is lifeless for its first hour, and the last-minute outpourings are too little, too late.
An evocative but ultimately hollow indie drama.
The diminishing returns in part are due to Burdge's performance, which too often settles for the same look of fraught anxiety. But they also result from Fidell's decision to pare her film down to the barest elements.
Ms. Fidell ... has a fine eye but not the makings of a feature-length movie here and, it quickly becomes clear, isn't interested in this relationship or the moral, ethical and legal issues it raises.
Fidell's mature style and Burdge's lack of guile are engaging. As the film's emotions grow darker, a lack of ideas comes through.
Glimpses of the relationship's dynamics can't overcome the missing sense of how these two first connected, an increasingly problematic void at the movie's core.
Failed to excite me.
Despite a deeply invested lead performance, A Teacher gives off strong vapors of phoniness; it's an exercise in lazy minimalism.
Neither character is given any depth or history. And since we're never privy to how their relationship began, there's no sense of what, if anything, is at stake for them.
Rather cold, the movie could have used some more humanity or, at the very least, dramatic excitement.
Mood divorced from meaning.
"A Teacher" will leave you feeling drained, even exhausted. That's about right for a movie about obsession, one with no resolution except waiting for the other thud to drop.
The intensity of Burdge's excellent performance-and Fidell's intense, often claustrophobic filmmaking-carries the picture far, but when she turns away from the camera (and she does often), you can almost feel Fidell reaching for spare ideas.
A Teacher feels a bit like watching some fool cross a busy freeway on foot over and over again for an hour and change. There's little to do but await the inevitable splat.
This nonjudgmental, opaque drama conjures up the emotional landscape of its troubled titular character but intentionally provides little insight into her thought process.
