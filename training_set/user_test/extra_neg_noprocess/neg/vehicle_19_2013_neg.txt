Neither particularly fast nor furious.
Vehicle 19 sets up a fascinating conceit for itself, and then loses interest in delivering on it. It just wants to get to the cool car chase, but by the time it does, we've stopped caring.
Mr. Walker's character is haunted by a troubled past, but the film would have been better if it had given him more to do in the present.
The plot is brainless even for a Paul Walker movie. Get ready for "The Slow and the Spurious."
A lean, low-budget and claustrophobic mistaken-identity thriller that's so stripped-down, it's nearly nonexistent.
[Walker] is forced to really act here. It's a task he faces with admirable dedication, if not unqualified success.
The degree to which Vehicle 19 flounders and ultimately fails is, to put it mildly, rather disappointing...
neither Walker nor the script can keep your interest for the duration, with action set pieces and intrusive music overpowering what should have been a claustrophobic and tense experience
The script is overwhelmed by cliches and implausibilities.
Low-tech and initially diverting, the feature soon rides on dramatically bald tires with Walker in the lead role, unable to squeeze out the necessary anguish to communicate the wrong place, wrong time feel of the script.
As one incoherent action scene follows another, one's left staring at a film with nothing to respond to, waiting for it all to be over.
Paul Walker is fine behind the wheel. But the chases are shot ineptly and what's a car chase movie without good looking chases?
An interesting idea paired with lacklustre execution makes for a passable rather than thrilling ride.
At first it's intriguing, then annoying, and finally it gives us the urge to get out and walk.
OMG, is this supposed to be this funny?
