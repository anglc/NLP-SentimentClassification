Halfway through, the movie loses its grip on logic and truth, and you stop believing it's based on anything other than the years the director spent in his youth, marching in the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade.
Beneath exhausts the appeal of its thinly sketched characters almost as soon as they're trapped together in the mine's emergency bunker ...
Although the actors and setting seem believable here, 'Beneath' ends up being much too predictable for a horror movie.
f there were double features nowadays, The DescentBeneath be the underwhelming B movie.
The film relies on too many contrivances and generic scare tactics, and there's not enough character depth to establish any emotional connection.
When does a bad, cheap horror movie becomes something more offensively horrible? When it pegs its generic nonsense on real-life tragedy and becomes exploitation.
Unable to choose between the horrors of a mine disaster and a ghostly force using the living as puppets. It's disappointing to realize that either direction will yield few thrills.
More troublesome than the lack of scares is the absence of even one remotely interesting character.
The film is impersonal and populated with wisps of characters who spend most of the running time wandering around in the dark yelling at one another.
