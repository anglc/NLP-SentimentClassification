The tone is irresolute, as if Zicherman, a self-proclaimed A.C.O.D., hadn't fully resolved his feelings before spinning them into this lumpy comedic drama.
Promising premise goes nowhere.
The film is too broad to be discerning, but there are a few laughs here and there, thanks to a solid comedic ensemble.
Not only is the movie just so-so, but the parts themselves aren't much.
Ephemeral as a Snapchat message.
...a busy movie for one running under 90 minutes, with people like Amy Poehler and Jessica Alba popping in with no-destination characters, and poor Mary Elizabeth Winstead wasted in the wings as Carter's patient girlfriend.
In spite of good intentions, A.C.O.D. fails to capitalize on its compelling 'Adult Children of Divorce' platform to present viewers with equally captivating insights.
It's often very funny, and tries to have some heart, too. But it doesn't straddle that line all too well ...
Has a few moments that shine, but the rest is shockingly leaden and clumsy, feeling around for a heart it hasn't earned and for laughs that seldom arrive.
N.O.
I really wanted to like this film because its cast is generally terrific in everything they do , but only Richard Jenkins and Catherine O'Hara really stand out here. A near-miss and sadly blah comedy that should have been smarter.
