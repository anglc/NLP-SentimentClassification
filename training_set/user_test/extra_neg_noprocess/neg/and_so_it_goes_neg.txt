Everything about the movie is as uninspired as the title.
[A] depressingly monotonous Rob Reiner-directed comedy starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton.
And So It Goes may touch the frayed heartstrings of some older viewers, but it's pretty bad - the failed attempt to Heimlich a venerable movie genre.
And So It Goes never goes quite far enough, in any direction.
As generic as its title.
... has some modest charm but overall remains mired in obvious plotting and cheap sentimentality.
...a pedestrian narrative that remains both predictable and uninvolving at virtually every turn...
When not saddled by the awkward narrative, Keaton and Douglas reveal a pleasing chemistry, though neither are doing anything new: Douglas growls while Keaton smiles, cries and sings.
It's great to see another romantic comedy/drama pitched at older audiences (they're often overlooked) but And So It Goes fails to creates something that is both memorable and meaningful.
I was absolutely appalled at Michael Douglas' performance in this and I thought he was really so unconvincing but... I think this screenplay is so bad that it's hard for any of those actors to make anything out of it.
Whatever happened to Rob Reiner?... [He] seems utterly disengaged as he ploddingly assembles a film whose potential is never realised.
These legendary stars don't disappoint in their first screen teaming, and Reiner should have trusted them more to completely take over the film a lot more quickly than he does.
Hilarity ensues. Or not.
Lukewarm romcom has some drug content, swearing.
Perhaps it's unfair to compare cinematic schmaltz like And So It Goes to Reiner's best work, but he and everyone involved have proven capable of so much more.
Douglas flails in search of a credible comic tone and Keaton doesn't so much play a character as wear a succession of signature getups. This is wrinkle porn at its laziest, cheesiest and most braindead. And so it blows.
Where former A-list actors go to end their movie careers. Next stop, a really bad alphabet network TV series.
Engaging, yet forgettable....it's aimed at a senior-citizen audience and should enjoy a long life as a DVD.
How you react to "And So It Goes" depends entirely on your appreciation of Diane Keaton. The movie is so Keaton-centric it might as well have been titled "La Di Da, La Di Da."
