I think I have a touch of apocalepsy -- excessive sleepiness caused by prolonged exposure to three- and four-part series in which adolescents rebel against oppressive governments represented by esteemed actors.
Is the true enemy this all-testosterone Lord of the Flies clan? Nah, faulting your fellow kids is so 1950s. For the millennials, adults gotta be to blame
The premise seems both smart and intriguing, but the film directed by Wes Ball bears many of the cruder markings of YA fiction.
... may ultimately be a better film when examined in the context of its potential successors, but taken on its own, it's a puzzling tease.
Shows an impressive turn of speed in places but runs out of puff before the finishing line.
Whither post-apocalyptic young adult sci-fi? With two movies to go, Hunger Games already feels overly familiar.
A sub-par YA adaptation that gets too bogged down in its own mechanics to adequately establish compelling characters or drama.

The latest in a long line of teen fantasies, The Maze Runner is a cagey dystopian thriller that tries to make a virtue of its limitations but becomes samey and tedious after a while.
In the annals of dystopian young-adult franchises, The Maze Runner is less than totes amazeballs.
Yet more celibate chiselled hotties in some ritualised game-playing future world, who discover that they are in some super-special way different, or divergent, or exceptional.
Utter garbage. The kids will love it.
