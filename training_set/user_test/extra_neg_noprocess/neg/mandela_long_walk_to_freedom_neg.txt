Nelson Mandela gets the Classics Illustrated treatment with this handsome, undemanding biopic.
The life of Nelson Mandela is simply too big, too complex and too important to be contained in one movie.
You keep wishing, as "Mandela" plays out, that this were more than one movie.
Aside from some youthful randiness early in the film, it wouldn't be out of place at a state funeral.
This film is only superficially illuminating, briefly informative; the drama is only mildly engaging, the imprisonment distantly horrific. It insists upon keeping us at an arm's length for its not inconsiderable running time.
Mandela pulls us through the leader's now familiar life story with a plodding pace.
What Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom ends up doing is flattering and sanctifying its subject. Mandela deserves better than kisses and compliments. So does the audience.
The film as a whole hits the highlights but too often fails to delve beneath the surface of Mandela or the ideals for which he fought his entire life.
It's a valuable history lesson crammed into a creatively uninspired movie. Wiki-cinema, if you will.
An extraordinary man probably deserved better than an ordinary film.
