There's certainly humor running through writer-director-star Clark Gregg's "Trust Me," the tale of an inept agent for child actors; it's just that not all of it feels intentional.
As the movie picks up speed and undergoes sudden, confusing plot reversals, it loses its satirical edge.
[Gregg] makes a tonally disastrous swerve ...
Despite solid performances, the cast can't inject much sympathy into these characters or their self-indulgent plight.
Seems forced into much darker territory in its final act. Gregg provides a prologue to foreshadow it, but it still doesn't quite fit.
Really can't compete on any level, being insipid and mean-spirited.
Its perky poster notwithstanding, "Trust Me" is a putatively hard-edged comedy that promises to turn into something harder.
...the final third of Trust Me winds up being so misguided, compared to the overly familiar first hour, that the entire affair just feels noxious.
Dramatically, Trust Me goes from stability to seppuku. It's the kind of picture that could be shut off at the hour mark and nothing would be missed.
