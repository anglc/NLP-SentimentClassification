Don't be surprised if, two weeks from now, you forget it ever existed.
Long on crimson spurts of blood but low on character, larded with production value but bereft of any other kind of it, "300: Rise of an Empire' is a 3D joke.
There is much grinding of teeth, and mauling of history, and anachronistic use of gunpowder, until we plug our ears and desperately pray to the gods of Olympus, or the brothers of Warner, that they might make an end.
If the movie's action recalls video games, the dramatically artificial lighting suggests 1980s rock videos. Indeed, Rise of an Empire is so campy that it might work better as a musical.
So utterly mind numbingly dull.
300: Rise of an Empire is nothing but an attempt at recapturing the glory of its predecessor through imitation.
"(An) action-fantasy that's far more fun to parody and poke fun at than it is to go back and watch."
...generally fares just a little bit better than its Zack Snyder-directed predecessor...
The story is interesting, but it's the look that director Noam Murro makes the focus of his '300: Rise of an Empire.'
There will be blood. And, of course, speeches about rising up against insurmountable odds and homoerotic subtext.
It's a big-budget helping of fanboy eye candy in which the action scenes are meant to be so dazzling that you ignore that it doesn't make much sense - or that you've basically seen it before.
More than any other element, Eva Green's performance singlehandedly elevates the film from the doldrums of its hermetic conception and execution.
Oafs in an uproar.
This sequel is a wholly second-rate effort, save for the incomparable Eva Green.
[Eva Green] s the single piece of spice that turns this 300 clone into a zestful, delightful bad movie instead of just a tedious, violence-loving slog.
[The story] gets constantly literally swamped by the blood and gore and so forth, which is well done but almost to the point of parody.
