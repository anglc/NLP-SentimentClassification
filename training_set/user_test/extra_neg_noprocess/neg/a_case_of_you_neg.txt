A Case Of You's characters and plot points will be familiar to anyone who's seen a movie in which a neurotic urbanite pines for a beautiful girl.
While this unrelentingly midtempo movie milks Brooklyn for its chic, it manages to denude it of its color.
A Case of You is a disappointing romantic comedy that aspires to social relevance until the third act, when it settles for pat Freudian revelations.
Wood makes Birdie approachable enough that Sam's continuing treatment of her as a fantasy-girl, who could only like a fictionalized version of him, grows tiresome as the film progresses.
If the movie managed to inspire even an iota of investment in whether or not Sam and Birdie (ugh) would end up together, I'd call it a perfectly adequate date night rental. But it's too insubstantial for that.
Some jokes land as intended, and there's a weirdly star-studded supporting cast, but Corio isn't brave enough to make the movie matter, eventually submitting to painfully labored formula to land this underwhelming effort.
Its third act conflict and resolution all seem motivated not by the characters on screen chafing at change, growth or surrender, but instead by scenes from other movies.
Simply not enough happens, and the screenwriters might have been wise to add a subsidiary relationship plotline to the mix, focus more on Sam's attempts at more serious writing, or just give those hungry, generous and funny actor pals more to do.
Kat Coiro's film takes the comedy of discomfort to new levels of cringe-worthiness by presenting.
There's some interesting ideas floating around about identity, manhood, and what it means to connect with someone in an over-connected world, but A Case Of You...never actively explores them.
