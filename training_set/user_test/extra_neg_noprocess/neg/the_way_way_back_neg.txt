The film has been complacently concocted for likability even as it gives you very little that's real, structured, or spontaneous enough to enjoy.
The coming-of-age tale The Way, Way Back is sweet, heartfelt and utterly trite and predictable from beginning to end.
This coming-of-age comedy/drama rings emotionally false during many of its jacked-up, stacked-deck emotional confrontations and mistakes obnoxiousness for personality in almost every adult character.
The story manages to be both very familiar and somehow not quite believable, in part because the characters feel contrived.
A coming-of-age tale by numbers that don't all add up.
