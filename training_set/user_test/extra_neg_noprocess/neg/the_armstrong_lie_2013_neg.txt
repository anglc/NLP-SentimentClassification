"The Armstrong Lie" simply offers up the Armstrong lie. Sorry, but we've all already heard that one.
It's a compelling story, though it doesn't really sustain a two-hour plus running time.
It's entirely possible you can't get to the heart of Armstrong because there is no heart, but I'd like to have seen someone have a go.
