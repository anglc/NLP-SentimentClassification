It's not worthless, but it's not good. As a genre film, it's too ambitious; as an art film, it's too obvious.
The pretentious, preposterous, dueling-dialect flameout called "Killing Season" has to stand as one of the biggest missed opportunities in iconic matchups.
If you've always wanted to see Robert De Niro forced to thread a steel rod through an open wound and then strung upside down by John Travolta, this is the movie for you.
Tables keep turning, traps keep springing and the actors keep acting, acting, acting.
The sight of Robert De Niro and John Travolta sharing the screen for the first time reps the one and only selling point of Killing Season.
A drawn out cat-and-mouse game never catches fire.
It wants to be a war-is-Hell 'coming home' story, but it ends up playing like a cheap action flick starring two men who are obviously too old to be running through the woods beating the living crap out of each other.
Comes full up with heavy-handed signifiers, from Ben's choice of reading (Hemingway...) to a hammered motif of lapsed Christianity (the climax takes place in a rotting church) that underlines the theme of living with the sins of the past. [Blu-ray]
... establishes some mild tension but never generates any sort of meaningful insight into post-war trauma.
Badly written, ineptly staged, horribly acted, historically suspect and boring beyond belief ...
Playing out like a brutally graphic Tom and Jerry skit at times, Killing Season lacks the atmospheric tension necessary to keep us consistently engaged.
Derivative and bizarrely graphic, Killing Season is nothing more than another forgettable entry in two ongoing filmographies that desperately need more inspired professional choices.
This barebones time-killer from the ruthlessly frugal folks at Millennium Films announces its intentions from the title on, and its two stars...seem glumly game to scowl their way through the proceedings with the professionalism of a mercenary...
Killing Season is competently put together, yet the woefully hollow dialogue and the predictable plot developments make for a pretty bland flick.
Make no mistake, for all the deferred killing, this is still a bloody affair, one which takes a grotesque glee in arrows being shot through faces and impromptu torture sessions.
let's just call this Grumpiest Old Men and get it over with
Calling this film a cat-and-mouse game would insult felines and rodents, both of which are much smarter than this movie.
