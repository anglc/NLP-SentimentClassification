There is something sharp, exciting and more original tucked within "The Berlin File" - and it is in moments a sleek, crackling film - but it all feels somehow misshapen.
The Berlin File benefits from gritty surroundings that add a cold war realism to this otherwise confusing tale of conflicted loyalties and secret agendas.
The story feels fairly perfunctory - not to mention unnecessarily knotty - but the well-connected leads do their best to ground it.
[A] formulaic but solid Cold War-style spy thriller, with North Korea pinch-hitting for the Soviet Union.
Everything here, except the action scenes, [feels] sluggish and rote.
Even though there's moments of exciting action and the reassembling of a government hierarchy violently taking place in front of you, The Berlin File is strapped to its restraints by its slow, meandering pace.
'The Berlin File' takes Hollywood's penchant for spectacle and ADD visual neurosis to its logical albeit absurd conclusion.
A sporadically entertaining, modestly ambitious shoot 'em up that frequently succumbs to spelling out its subtext.
