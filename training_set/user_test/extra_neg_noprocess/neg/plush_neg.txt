It feels so inauthentic at every turn, it's as if the film itself is unsure of what it's supposed to be.
Plush is all over the map, but when its characters prattle on about how important their art is amidst all that terrible pose-heavy music, its really insufferable.
Plush feels too familiar to leave any sort of impression. It throws together a cast that is mostly full of actors from similar genres, but even then Plush seems like a rehash of everything each actor did previously.
Plush is just a B-movie B-side that few will take note of, a modern riff on Fatal Attraction that shoots for edgy, and lands on silly.
Doesn't have a single interesting idea to share, wallowing in excess and stupidity, paying more attention to the thickness of eyeliner than the complexity of its mystery.
