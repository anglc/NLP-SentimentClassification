Nerd wish-fulfillment of the first order, this Canadian rom-com places an artificial barrier between its cute-as-a-button leads and asks us to stick around for an hour and a half until it's artificially removed.
Long before the script permits the characters to acknowledge the obvious, you lose patience: Jump into the deep end of the bed already. It would be more fun and friendly to all concerned, especially the audience.
Director Michael Dowse ("Take Me Home Tonight") can't quite decide on a tone -- sly, whimsical or wacky? -- but the problem is the material.
With little risk taken, here is a film you've seen a million times before, and sadly, will see a million times again.
While Radcliffe and Kazan do their best with this skimpy material, their back-and-forth banter is, like, super-annoying?
This movie could leave you with the kind of indigestion that comes from formula.
Advance buzz about this rom-com is that it would subvert the genre, which couldn't be further from the truth. It simply reassigns the cliches to trendier personalities. It is a tired rom-com in boutique clothing. 'Girls' with far less dangerous boys.
The whole thing is clearly trying much too hard, but in its earnest, sloppy way is impossible to hate, the way it's impossible to hate an ugly dog.
There are some reasonable moments, and Kazan brings all her cherubic prettiness and vulnerability, but I can't help thinking it appeared to better effect in her own romantic fantasy, Ruby Sparks.
