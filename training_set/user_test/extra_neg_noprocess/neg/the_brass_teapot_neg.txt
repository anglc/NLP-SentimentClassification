A comic fable that squanders its twisted-fairy-tale concept.
Temple and Angarano, entertaining enough, never quite sell the idea that this goodhearted couple would be so easily transformed by greed.
Without a human dimension to ground its construct, "The Brass Teapot" ultimately feels like an interminably stretched-out skit rather than a storybook lesson stained with blood and hurt.
Ms. Mosley, who directed from a screenplay by Tim Macy, struggles to fill her debut feature with a slender notion, but the premise defeats her, even if the story operates at the outset on the pleasure principle.
The Brass Teapot too often devolves into stale slapstick ...
I'm left wondering: Doesn't a teapot have better things to do than force its demonic will on others, including an innocent, naive couple? Actually, I'm not wondering about that at all. I prefer coffee.
Tthe energetic lead performances bring some smiles for fans of Angarano and Temple. The story is less successful though as aside from its unique premise it has very little to offer thanks to its very familiar moral.
This oddball dark comedy might have made an amusing short film, but its one-note concept wears thin at feature length.
The screenplay falters, introducing ridiculous villains and featuring thorough lapses in logic in a blur of strained drama.
Missing numerous layers of sickness, fearful of pushing a plot of pain on its audience, forcing them to study the complexity of unsavory desires with unlikable characters.
This dark comedy makes a few smart observations about the lengths people will go to snag the American Dream, but its satiric edge gets dulled rather quickly.
