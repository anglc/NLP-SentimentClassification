Simultaneously overblown and underdeveloped, "Iceman" fails equally at showcasing the talent of its star and resolving its baroque plot.
The story is unnecessarily muddled and confusing in the telling, and the athletically gifted Yen is overshadowed by largely mediocre CGI effects. Revisit the original instead.
Iceman is an inconsistent mess that features Donnie Yen in his action packed prime but spends too much time dragging its audience through unnecessary and disgusting comedy.
Law's lame-brained concoction aims to be, in equal parts, a martial-arts opus, low-brow crowd-pleaser and mystical history lesson; what emerges is an often incomprehensible mash-up that plays murky, amateurish and puerile.
