Butt is a decent word-spinner and self-deprecating funny man, but the decision to have the rest of the cast play it straight is a mistake; it's as if he plugged his performance into a weak Law and Order episode.
Butt is, it becomes increasingly clear, simply not funny in the slightest...
If [Butt] could make the serious bits feel bigger, as opposed to just windrow dressing to his jokes, he'd have a parody worth really taking seriously.
