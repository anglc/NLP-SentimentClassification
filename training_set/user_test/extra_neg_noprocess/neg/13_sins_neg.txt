An empty, efficient thriller that leaves you as cold as most of its characters.
Never satisfyingly accounts for how the unseen puppeteer manages to keep a constant eye on Elliot's every move.
The "Saw" formula of a mysterious voice guiding our hero through a series of depravities has gone a bit stale.
13 Sins throws its audience into an obstacle course it's already completed several times before. Redundant and predictable, 13 Sins fails at igniting much interest within the viewer.

...this is one of those mind games that lean too heavily on the mindless to be thoroughly enjoyable, turning sadistic pleasure into harmless boredom.

Sluggish morality-play-cum-horror movie that wastes much of its shock value on an impenetrable mythology.
13 Sins tries to demonstrate the potential everyone has to fall down a slippery moral slope, but the missions get so ridiculous and gruesome [...] that it's hard to take the film seriously, even on its heightened terms.
