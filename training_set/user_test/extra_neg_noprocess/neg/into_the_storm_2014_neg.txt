What we've got here is somewhere between Twister and one of those storm-chaser reality shows, except Jan de Bont made Twister.
When the badass cyclones muscle into town, ripping up schools, banks and airports, the film is fairly fun. Sadly, everything else about it is, well, a bit of a disaster.
If weak plotting isn't a big concern, then Into the Storm may be right up your tornado alley.
Have we ever before seen such big-ticket escapist entertainment about the awesomeness of something that so recently killed so many of us? Doesn't it usually take longer before everyone's eager for candy spun from trauma?
If the visual effects in "Into the Storm" were matched with a better screenplay, we'd be talking about a box office juggernaut. As it stands, I would recommend an Irwin Allen disaster flick for better acting.
(Will) blow out of town as quickly as it came.
So much time is spent justifying the presence of all these cameras that no one bothered to create a single character worth rooting for.
Lacking zero plot development, other than "here comes the next storm," "Into the Storm's" only saving point are the visual effects, rendered in all of their Dolby glory.
While Into the Storm has the look of a satirical disaster film, it completely lacks any satire, taking itself far too seriously (and offers nothing original) to be anywhere near as fun as its genre-spawning second-cousin, Sharknado.
If it's a twister film you desire, save your money and revisit the only one worthy of the name.
What happens between the storm set-pieces is not worth mentioning.
The rotating funnel clouds are almost spectacular enough to make up for the rote drama (a strict dad butts heads with his teenage son, yawn) and routine characterization (redneck comic relief, yee-haw).
The genre's chief annoyance of characters who can't seem to let go of cameras in life-threatening situations hasn't got any less aggravating.
Most inexplicable, yet potent, are the shots that look down on the devastation from on high, implicitly reducing the entire cast to extras in a movie directed by God.
Once the dust settles after Into the Storm has ripped your cinema screen in two, it curiously leaves little evidence it was ever there.
"I've never seen anything like this!" gravely intones weather expert Dr Allison Stone midway through Into The Storm - but alas, we have seen many, many things like this.
Into the Storm sets forth as a found-footage thriller before losing its thread and then doubling back on itself in abject disarray.
Annoyingly, it's a found-footage film, so prepare to be buffeted by shaky camerawork aplenty as the windy plot blows the flimsily drawn protagonists this way and that.
