Beautiful Creatures is like the Twilight movies but with a chaperone making sure the boys dance a foot apart from the girls.
'Beautiful Creatures' is stylish, campy fun at times.
The movie is claimed ... by narrative incoherence, Tim Burton-envy and the usual demons of digital effects.
A dash -- only a dash -- of Tim Burton ghoulishness might have helped.
A superficial supernatural story that aimlessly seeks to follow in the footsteps of 'Twilight.'
Beautiful Creatures is a half-filled glass of teen pablum...
I found myself growing incredibly bored by the film. Nothing was new or fresh enough to earn my interest.
Any hope of tapping into the Twilight vibe is pretty much neutered by the film's haphazard storyline, stuttering pace and inordinate length.
Trying to become the next "Twilight," it is a better film in most respects than any entry in that franchise - although that's damning it with faint praise.
We rush through the background of the characters with the focus more on building the lovey-dovey relationship between Ethan and Lena.
Alice Englert and Alden Ehrenreich give performances that make this thing worth seeing. Given that the story is preposterous, it's entertaining enough to keep you awake most of the time.
Interesting settings and costumes plus plus weird ghostly stuff can't save this fantasy romance. Still, Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert seem sincere and committed to their co-starring roles here.
