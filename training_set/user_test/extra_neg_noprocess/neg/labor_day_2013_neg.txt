Jason Reitman forgot the tapioca.
"Labor" isn't just a word in the title of Jason Reitman's new film, it's a description of what it feels like to sit through the movie.
The story unfolds with an earnestness so implacable that on the rare occasions when a bit of humor sneaks into the proceedings it feels like an uninvited party guest.
Nothing against Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin and director Jason Reitman - top talents all - but my goodwill drowned while trying to swallow this treacly cocktail of romantic swill.
It's a shame, particularly, that the talent of Winslet is wasted here. Her presence should have been the transformative factor, but she can't patch the holes in the story.
The initial Hitchcockian tension soon slackens into slop, with a dash of lukewarm eroticism.
Teeters on the brink of self-parody.
Labor Day is a humourless and heavy-handed melodrama built around an extremely unlikely romance.
The story is ludicrous. The reveals are unintentionally hilarious and clumsily delivered. Even the production design is off.
The really baffling thing is that this clunker has been written, directed and produced by Jason Reitman, whose previous movies include Juno and Up in the Air. What was he thinking?
Labor Day lacks this film-maker's usual sophisticated wit: it is bizarrely unconvincing, sugary and humourless, like a Walt Disney version of The Night of the Hunter.
May become a candidate for camp mini-classic status.
Director Jason Reitman comes a-cropper with this unconvincing Southern melodrama starring Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin.
You wish that Reitman had brought the material under control - or better yet, let its cheap manipulations and gushy eroticism run riot.
