The film was adapted from a novel by Aislinn Hunter, but the characters' inner lives remain elusive.
Static and uninvolving despite a decent cast.
Despite the affecting performances by the two leads, this overly muted drama fails to make much of an impact.
Too often ... the darker, more serious moments in Stay are only temporary distractions from the main event - a familiar tale of romantic separation and reconciliation.
The knife that tried to half this potato gets stuck somewhere along the way, and by the time we meander towards the foregone conclusion, the fumes force us to turn away and not look back.
I can't imagine what type of picture there would be without Quinn and Schilling's commitment, but their professional investment helps to save a mediocre movie from becoming just another bland soul-searching drama.
While there's always a case to be made for filmmaking that doesn't traffic in artificially heightened emotions, the solution isn't necessarily to bring things in under the bar, either.
Quinn and Schilling both bring welcome nuances of expression and movement, but neither character amounts to much more than a petulant whiner.
...an earnest misfire...
Neither one of these characters elicits much sympathy from the audience from the very get-go, and this presents von Carolsfeld with a challenge that proves insurmountable by the final frames.
