A movie whose punch line is so delightfully absurd that even after you pretty much know what's coming you spit out your Pepsi anyway.
Keeping up with the movie's inane plot twists makes for a capricious good time, but an unimaginative denouement turns the whole thing into a fool's errand.
[The] final reel ... descends into the Vortex of Bonkers, delivering fits of unexpected laughter.
