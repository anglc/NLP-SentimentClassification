Slate is too pretty a face and Robespierre is too limited a writer for Obvious Child to rise above conventional romantic plotting or to make its low comedy meaningfully transgressive.
As a rom-com, it's so safe and unchallenging that it won't stick in your brain long enough for the message to matter.
I left 'Obvious Child' thinking not of Donna, the story's heroine, but of Jenny Slate, an intriguing screen presence who deserves better material.
