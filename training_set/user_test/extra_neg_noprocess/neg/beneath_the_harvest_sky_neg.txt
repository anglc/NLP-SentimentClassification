Teenagers in a dead-end town aren't exactly a trailblazing topic.
The performances in "Beneath the Harvest Sky" are better than the movie itself, an exceedingly derivative teen melodrama that too often loses focus and meanders off on lugubrious tangents with its criminal subplots.
Beneath the Harvest Sky never finds a proper balance between its two halves. They never cohere properly, and the results pitch and lurch rather than harmonize.
It flourishes in the spaces between the plot's necessary setups and subsequent payoffs, which is nearly enough to redeem the film if not for the narrative going belly up in the third act.
Harvest Sky [has an] overall familiarity, embodied by two lead performances that aren't nearly as specific and detailed as the milieu they inhabit.
...filmmakers Aron Gaudet and Gita Pullapilly offer up a central character, in the form of Cohen's Casper, that couldn't possibly be more unlikable...
