Michael Cudlitz's first leading role is the sole selling point of this repellent character study.
Griffith's vulnerable performance is a standout. But the film's final third seems needlessly graphic.
"Dark Tourist" takes an effectively unpleasant trip down the lost highway of a morbid mind before its bad choices start catching up with it.
"Dark Tourist" gets bogged down in insufferably slow-moving scenes - interestingly, when Jim is interacting with others, despite consummate performances from Cudlitz and Griffith.
Degenerate, depraved psycho-sexual drama revolving around a pathetic thrill-seeker who travels with intent to visit places of tragedy or disaster.
