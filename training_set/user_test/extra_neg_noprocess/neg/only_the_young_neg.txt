A charming, aimless film about the aimless. It plays like a nuanced MTV reality show (an oxymoron, perhaps, but you get the idea).
Co-directors Jason Tippet and Elizabeth Mims show genuine affection for their subjects but, despite some evocative visuals, never zero in on an involving structure or narrative.
