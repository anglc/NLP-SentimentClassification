There are just so many ways Carine Roitfeld can say she loves fashion in "Mademoiselle C," a somewhat interesting documentary that brings us into the inner workings of a magazine, but harps a bit too much on her ideas of fashion and style.

...hard to follow, relatively incoherent,...she is shown as a peripatetic presence, with seeming indefatigable energy. But she talks so much during the first hour that it becomes enormously annoying...
