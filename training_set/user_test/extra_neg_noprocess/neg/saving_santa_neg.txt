On this evidence, Santa's sadly not worth saving.
The colourful, simplified computer-generated animation will be easy on the eye for youngsters ( ... ) that the singing is sometimes less polished than parts of Mamma Mia! won't matter to older toddlers.
I watched it with a nine-year-old who said: "This film is so annoying I want to kick it!"
Voiced by a recognisable cast, Saving Santa is a pleasant and well-timed festive animation, but its unsophisticated storyline, general lack of humour and substandard soundtrack ultimately let it down.
