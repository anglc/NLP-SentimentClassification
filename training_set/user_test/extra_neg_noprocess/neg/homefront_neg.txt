I can barely remember who lives or dies. I barely cared.
The screenplay for this violent retro schlock was written by Sylvester Stallone, and the movie feels like something out of the early eighties.
'Homefront' just isn't the Southern-fried smackdown it should have been
Everyone cast against type. Everyone breathtakingly bad, reciting dialogue by Sylvester Stallone that begs for a "mute" button.
By making Statham a regretful lawman, it neutralizes his main talent, effectively neutering him. It also telegraphs the kind of mostly watered-down movie we're about to see.
Statham is not the English Clint Eastwood yet, but if someone fancied calling him Dirty Jason... who knows?
Oh, and did I mention that Sylvester Stallone adapted the screenplay for this from a novel? Because that.
The climax is a muddle and borderline preachy
It's a derivative and incoherent exercise that provides another opportunity for Jason Statham to play the same type of vigilante character that he's essentially kept repeating for more than a decade.
The plot is too foreordained in every detail to be genuinely gripping, and the action far too shoddy in both conception and execution, which is even worse.
A Definite Miss
Skull-cracking and stylistic, it's a ferocious, profanity-filled revenge flick that should have gone direct-to-video.
