The one person who gets the balance right, weighing parody and homage, is the composer, Joel McNeely, whose opening theme stirs hopes and memories that the movie cannot match.
A Million Ways to Die in the West feels like about 80 minutes of material was padded out to 110 minutes.
In A Million Ways to Die in the West, director-star Seth MacFarlane builds an imposing, affectionate reconstruction of the American movie West, then defaces it with funny mustaches -- often literally.
Despite all the costumes, stunt work, and locations in Monument Valley, this big-budget western spoof by Seth MacFarlane is too glib to live up to its potential.
There are moments of wit in the script, and one or two strong scenes, but the film feels oddly directionless for much of its runtime.
Audiences high on popcorn fumes will laugh along at the smut. But, at its core, this is a spiritually empty vessel trying to make a lot of box office noise. Blazing Saddles (1974) or Cat Ballou (1965) it ain't.
There are a million moments in which to contemplate your own demise while watching the smug self-indulgence and cheap, overelaborated non-comedy of this vanity project.
There is plenty to amuse in A Million Ways to Die in the West, but it's not a very good movie.
MacFarlane's legions of fans will no doubt flock to his latest reckless creation with an eagerness to please, but afterward they might just plead with him to keep his day job.
While I'm sure fans will find something to appreciate, I personally found this to be the worst comedy since Adam Sandler's Grown Ups 2 and easily one of the worst of the year.
A Million Ways to Die in the West spends more time trying to push the buttons of its audience rather than entertaining it. It's amusing in small doses, but as a whole it's about three horseshoes away from being an atrocity to the comedy genre.
It forces characters into situations that are silly without reason, and expects the premise to substantiate a lot of bizarre twists that seem to exist out of total conceit.
A comedy that desperately wants to emulate Mel Brooks, but fails in every respect.
Well-meaning sheep farmer runs afoul of ruthless gunfighter. Also, Neil Patrick Harris sh*ts in a hat.
MacFarlane is one of the few male comic creative talents to have honed a style that stands against the Judd Apatow school of realism, but the movie just doesn't quite work.
As scatter-shot as a double-barreled shotgun packed with rock salt. Come back Lili Von Shtupp.
