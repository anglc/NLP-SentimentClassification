Roberts is completely over-the-top here, her frantic, unfunny performance serving only to highlight Cusack's caginess and restraint.
"Adult World" is a coming-of-age story in which the starting age seems to be approximately 9. As a result, it just doesn't work.
The movie is rated R, yet sensitive 12-year-old girls and the boys scared to talk to them probably represent the ideal audience for this wan coming-of-age sitcom in feature-film drag.
Adult World may have meaning, but you have to trudge through waist deep piles of unfiltered, prepubescent, overdramatic whimpering just to get to it.
"Adult World" is amusing, if a bit by the numbers. There's nothing surprising about Amy's story.
A nice shot of reality could've saved Adult World, as the details of desperation are far more compelling than the rusted mechanics of a numbing coming-of-age story.
Never quite fully delivers much more than yet another oh-poor-me take on post-collegiate struggles in the cold, cruel 21st Century.
