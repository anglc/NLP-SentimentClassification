The film seems inexplicably tame, the least interesting execution of a radical concept.
Boll spends so much time painting Jim into the corner required to "justify" his bonkers actions that once the film's fuse is irrevocably lighted, viewers may have already checked out.
This zeitgeist-tapping revenge fantasy doesn't deliver enough guilty pleasures.
Because it wouldn't be Boll if there wasn't borderline irresponsible storytelling.
...the age of being offended by this sort of thing might also be long-gone: the only question on viewers' minds during the film's violent climax is how exactly Boll was able to get so much shoddy footage on location.
Uwe Boll's insistence on plugging genre tropes into his imagined idea of populism returns us to the same cynical place as Postal, except with none of the sizzle.
