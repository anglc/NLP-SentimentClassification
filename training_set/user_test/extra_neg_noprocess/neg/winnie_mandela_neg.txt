This biopic is part hagiography, part expose, and gravely incoherent.
"Winnie Mandela'' really stumbles when it comes to depicting the couple's painful separation, which the film suggests resulted more from politics than Winnie's infidelity.
Despite the marquee names and their obvious talent, the film feels like a made-for-TV movie.
Distant and obvious, it takes a story with many angles and reduces its edges, becoming a glorified TV movie.
Winnie Mandela is a simplistic look at a complex figure.
The end credits song's beautifully delivered, full-throttle emotional bombast only serves as a dismaying reminder of how much the film otherwise lacks any similar passion and soul.
The audacity and determination of its subject doesn't find its way into this shallow and superficial biopic.
Though Winnie Mandela is a more-than-serviceable classroom recounting of events, it fails to reach much higher than that, and deals with identity issues when deciding whether to challenge your views or simply glorify real-life events.
A warts-and-all biopic which focuses on its subject's childhood, college days and marriage while making short shrift of her transition into a war criminal.
The film's tonal inconsistencies speak less to the struggles of its titular subject than to its own grasp-exceeding ambitions.
Biopic is well acted but uneven and violent.
'Winnie' is no masterpiece, but not nearly as bad as the early reviews.
ultimately too earnest for its own good
