As progressive as it might feel for fat guys, losers and salsa stalwarts, it's rotten for women
It's not a bad gimmick, but the movie turns tediously sentimental fast.
It ends up feeling a little like warmed-over Strictly Ballroom without Baz Lurhmann's over-the-top sense of style.
A little more fury might have been a whole lot better.
Nick Frost delivers one of the great physical performances of the modern cinema era. Sexually, though, [Cuban Fury] is inexplicably playing for a decidedly 'adult humour' audience, thus eliminating ( ... ) family audiences.
Being about 70% romantic-comedy and 30% quirky underdog sports movie, to call the plot of Cuban Fury predictable would be an understatement.
If "Cuban Fury" launches Frost into bigger and better films, it's worth it.
Doesn't have a personality of its own, in dire need of a more robust collection of laughs and a few less painfully contrived subplots.
No amount of fancy footwork can disguise the sketchy one-joke nature of this British comedy.
Overall, this movie is out-of-step.
Too mild for its own good, a formulaic 'worm turns' story that doesn't take full advantage of its dance milieu.
Too steeped in tropes and genre conventions without daring to color outside the lines.
Frost proves here he can carry a film on his own, although I would like to see him featured in a better movie.
