If the onscreen serial killer isn't having fun, how can we?
Director Doug Aarniokoski and co-screenwriter David Loughery fail to infuse the overly familiar elements with the necessary dark humor.
"Nurse 3D" isn't nearly as fun as a movie about a homicidal, sex-obsessed, clothing-averse health care provider ought to be.
Taken at face value -- which is the only way one can probably take Nurse -- it still comes up short.
Nurse is one of those modern, pre-fabricated cult movies like The Human Centipede or Sharknado, designed to be talked about amongst friends though never truly satisfying as a genuinely interesting piece of exploitation cinema.
As raw exploitation, Nurse 3D [...] over-promises and under-delivers, which might have been inevitable with a title like that.
Nurse doesn't carry all the way to the end. It's salacious, macabre, and visually competent, but as a B-movie fireworks display, it mostly launches duds.
Rather than capture truly pained souls tangled in exuberant horror tropes, the filmmakers settle for retrograde anguish and warmed-over artistry.
