Fairly routine brunette-fighting-for-survival stuff with a liberal dose of dark humour.
Maybe, in another time and place, and with different actors and a better director, it might have worked. But this thing collapses right from the get-go.
Not every slasher can be as smart as "The Cabin in the Woods" or "Scream," but if they weren't going to at least try something new (or at least come up with a better mid-way reveal), then why bother at all?
Horror fans might take some enjoyment from all the grisly deaths, but it's not long before a nagging sense of killing fatigue sets in. Call it 'goredom', if you will.
Tthis run-of-the-mill slash-'em-up flick has been floating around for two years looking for a distributor. Unfortunately, it found one.
