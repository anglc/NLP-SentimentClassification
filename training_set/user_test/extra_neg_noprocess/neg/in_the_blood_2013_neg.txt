This isn't much more than a straight-forward, get-the-baddies action flick.
The jaw-drop factor that comes from seeing Carano's moves is often spoiled because of too much cutting or, in the case of the dance club sequence, excess strobing.
Carano is an impressive woman, but she's no Meryl Streep; and even Streep couldn't make a movie this by-the-numbers look like anything more than it is: violence with interruptions.
In the Blood is generic B-movie fare, bloody and, alas, increasingly dumb.
Essentially a gender-swapped riff on the Taken films, the film is as by the numbers as they come.
Most of the dialogue consists of "Where is my husband?" And, for variety: "Tell me where my husband is!"
What starts as a mystery involving shadowy gangsters on an unnamed tropical island turns into a sort of medical drama involving endless fights, torture, and gunfire.
"In the Blood" is a dull piece of nonsense that makes one feel bad for straight-to-DVD staples like Treat Williams, Danny Trejo, and Luis Guzman.
