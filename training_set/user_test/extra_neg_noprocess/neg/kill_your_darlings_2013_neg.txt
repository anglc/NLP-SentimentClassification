Overall the movie seems to wander, like the worst excesses of free verse, needing a little structure to rein it in.
Few [Harry] Potter fans will be tempted to chance their luck while most adults will be left with fearsomely bright but relatively unlovable characters.
...one of the most incompetent and flat-out interminable biopics to come around in quite some time...
Lively and driven personalities are indeed what made the Beat Generation what it was, and what it continues to be. Kill Your Darlings seems content, however, to find superficial imitations of them.
A good showcase for some of our most talented working young male actors, but not much more.
The film suffers from the same problems as last year's On The Road, namely an undue reverence towards its characters.
Ultimately, it's oddly conservative fare; well played, handsomely mounted, but as inert as the books that its protagonists blithely hurl from the shelves.
