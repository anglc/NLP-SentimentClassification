Only those scared of being bored to death need fear "Locker 13," an omnibus of horror stories that could hardly be more tame, talky and tepid, both individually and as a whole.
An alternately creaky and intriguing ride, one of earnest ambition and dashed potential.
The transition from comedy to horror (and back) never fully gels, and nobody seems "on the trolley" with the period jargon.
As a die-hard fan of the horror anthology film, I take no pleasure in stating that Locker 13's few stray glimmers of quality are not worth the slog it takes to find them.
Locker 13 isn't a film so much as a dire symptom of a culture in which the ability to fund a movie has become reason enough to make one.
While the finale at least puts the notion of an evil locker to some practical use, it might have been better if the filmmakers simply stored all the copies of "Locker 13" inside the haunted contraption and threw away the key.
Nothing here is terribly haunting, but at least someone is trying to make something like a horror movie these days that isn't about buckets of gore and inventive torture.
