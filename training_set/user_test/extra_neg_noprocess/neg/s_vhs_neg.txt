Less is not necessarily more in this slimmed-down collection.
Found footage is all well and good, but if it's unwatchable, it might as well have stayed lost.
One hit, one acceptable miss, one miss, and one dead-on-arrival mistake. Still a better percentage than the first movie, or most found-footage horror as a whole.
If you're a fan of the original V/H/S production, this is bound to compel you, however if you left the last feeling somewhat disgruntled and underwhelmed, don't expect enough of an increase in quality to sway you this time around.
