Like so many campaigning docs this is much more interested in throwing darts at the other guys than giving us a balanced film.
The film's tone is boosterish, and the cursory treatment of the cost of a nuclear-based energy overhaul, or the viability of renewable energy, tends to arouse skepticism rather than allay it.
There's not much in the way of balance in this often bone-dry documentary about the bum rap nuclear power has gotten thanks to misinformed, if well-meaning, environmentalists and energy experts.
Pandora's Promise gives up enough information to tease the curiosity of doubting individuals but unfortunately as a piece of subversive, cogent filmmaking - it's a box of empty promises.
The film's blatantly one-sided presentation undercuts the pro-nuclear argument more than any counterargument.
The result is a thoughtful documentary whose facts and figures have been compromised by Stone's one-sided approach.
