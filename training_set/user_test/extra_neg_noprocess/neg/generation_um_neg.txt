Neither the film, nor the film within the film, hold our attention. Bummer, Keanu.
Director Mark L. Mann seems to be searching for the meaning in aimlessness, and in lowered expectations. But too often the narrative left me feeling the titular "um."
Meandering and affected, this tedious character study is as aimless as the lives it depicts.
A slapped-together sub-mumblecore exercise that at times suggests a feature-length expansion of 2010â€²s "Sad Keanu" meme
What does it add up to? Um ... I have no idea and don't really care.
"Um" winds up as empty as its mean streets are phony.
While Reeves brings more depth to his character than the script warrants, the film overall lacks compelling characters and winds up depressing instead of profound.
A single, plotless day in New York in the company of Keanu Reeves feels like a life sentence.
The point of the movie seems to be: like, inarticulation, or something?
It's a patience-tester, salvaged only a smidge by Reeves's uncanny ability to remain perfectly still while his co-stars strap on acting school rocket packs and pinball around the frame.
The levels of insight provided into the characters are exactly commensurate with any conceivable viewer's interest in learning more about these nonentities.
a bafflingly irreverent, meandering character study that resurrects Reeves' trademark inscrutable delivery, providing the actor with his most characteristic performance in years. But that's not quite enough to salvage the movie.
Despite strong performances from Keanu Reeves, Bojana Novakovic and Adelaide Clemens, Generation Um... doesn't give us enough of a story to keep us fully invested throughout its running time.
