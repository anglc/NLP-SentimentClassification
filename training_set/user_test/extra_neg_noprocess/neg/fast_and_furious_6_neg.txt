Exists purely to showcase how idiotically over-the-top action sequences can become when annoyances like gravity are tossed to the side.
How you feel about "Fast & Furious 6" is a matter of perspective.
Jaggedly oscillates between action absurdity and familial drama.
A soap opera with a casual disregard for physics.
The biggest laugh, though, comes at the end, with a prim, don't-try-this-at-home disclaimer.
This Formula 6 racing flick's tire-spinning in a vacuum: the plausible's passed early on, the ludicrous is smoked down the stretch, and any lingering basic law of action-film gravitas is shredded by the finish line.
...Furious 6 fares noticeably worse than its surprisingly entertaining (yet far-from-flawless) predecessor...
At least a half-hour too long, "Fast and Furious 6â€³ is not fast, which made my backside furious.
There is comfort in familiarity, which is why having original cast members back together... is a definite asset,
The target audience won't care as much about the characters with two arms and two legs as it will about the characters with four wheels.
Not every action film needs a prompt disclaimer in the credits, but Fast 6 is dim-witted enough to need one
