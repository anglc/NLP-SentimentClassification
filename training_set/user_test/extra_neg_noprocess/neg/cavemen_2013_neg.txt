An unevolved romantic comedy better suited to the Paleolithic Era.
Herschel Faber, the writer and director here, didn't bother fleshing out these characters enough to make us give a hoot about them.
"Cavemen" writer-director Herschel Faber has sketched such a thin and unfunny look at L.A. singles, it should mark the death knell for movies about child-men on the make.
Apparently answering the unasked question, "What would happen if you told a 12-year-old at screenwriting camp to combine Swingers and (500) Days of Summer?"
A dismal rom-com for dudes that makes the average beer commercial look nuanced and plot-heavy.
A screenwriter tries to fall in love in order to lend authenticity to his script about a man falling in love in Cavemen, a tiresome film that itself knows nothing but other rom-com plots.
A blockheaded, sigh-inducing retread that evinces neither any particular originality nor freshness of telling.
Cavemen shows occasional glimmers of promise, but ultimately winds up feeling just like Jay's blowjob story: meandering, somewhat dull, and with little payoff.
Cavemen is an apt title considering how the sensibility and maturity of the film's characters don't seem to have developed beyond primal, alpha-man impulses.
It's truly a mystery as to how this movie got made -- and why anybody (excluding horny L.A. guys) would want to see it.
If I read this screenplay, I'd probably immediately ban Dean and Herschel from Hollywood.
