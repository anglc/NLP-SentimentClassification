There's too much going on: the Marvel Universe stuff, the WikiLeaks-ish paranoia stuff, the video game-ish CG visual effects stuff, the epic John Woo-ish everybody-pointing-a-weapon-at-everybody-else face-off stuff.
I will pay $50 to anyone who can prove that one single audience member worldwide texted "OMG, this plot is fantastic!" at any point during or after the movie.
A substantial disappointment after 2011's better-than-expected Captain America: The First Avenger...
If only the film's level of visual creativity could have been applied to the story, it might feel like a standalone success instead of merely another link in the chain.
