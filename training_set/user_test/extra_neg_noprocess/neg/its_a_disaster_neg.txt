You need better dialogue than Berger supplies to help It's a Disaster make a liar out of its title.
As visually interesting as nuclear fallout.
Despite the strength of his writing and his cast, Berger still falters when it comes to the final act.
An uneven, underwritten amalgam of comedy, drama and suspense that fails to pack a comedic, emotional or intellectual punch.
