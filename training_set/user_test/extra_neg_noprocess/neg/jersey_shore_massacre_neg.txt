There's no ignoring the aggressive stupidity and crassness behind the whole enterprise.
I felt like I needed to take a shower before I went back inside my house.
Acknowledging Hurricane Sandy, "Jersey Shore Massacre" reminds viewers that it's hardly the worst disaster to hit the region. But it gives the Hindenburg stiff competition.
"Jersey Shore Massacre" doesn't even take place on the Jersey Shore, nor do any of the reality show's stars show up despite Jenni (JWOWW) Farley's prominent billing as an executive producer.
Watching the hopelessly vapid get taken out, one by one, has never been more depressing.
Distinctly unimaginative in its third act but competently made nonetheless, "Jersey Shore Massacre" should divert viewers under the right circumstances. Otherwise, this is pretty disposable fare.
Brutal even by B movie standards, making for one of the longer 88 minutes no viewer should ever be forced to have to endure.
This irredeemably awful film should only be viewed under threat of grievous bodily harm. And even then, you should give your choice some careful consideration.
What keeps Jersey Shore Massacre lively is that this mean-spirited, aggressively stupid film constantly finds new and shocking ways to be terrible.
Imagine the cast of MTV's Jersey Shore stuck in a slasher movie - but then remove any bits of entertainment, intelligence or respectful execution you might assume would be present. Who pulled the pin on this grenade?
