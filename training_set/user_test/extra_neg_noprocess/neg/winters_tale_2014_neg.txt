On a purely narrative level, Winter's Tale missteps early and often. Its earnestness is its downfall, resulting in opportunities for unintentional humor.
We never come to understand the magic that keeps Farrell looking like a member of My Chemical Romance for 10 decades. We never know why consumption makes women sexy.
It's so filled with high-flown blather about love, destiny and miracles that there's no room for enchantment.
If only there was less mush and more meat in this stew.
Winter's Tale is preposterous twaddle. Use it as a date movie only if you don't love the one you're with.
It might all make more sense to fans of the book. But you shouldn't have to have read the book to be able to see and enjoy the movie.
The only way to even potentially sell any of this was to play it so straight that it hurts a little, and Akiva Goldsman and crew did that, even when it broke the film.
Exquisitely awful. I was reminded of M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water, in that both are attempts at building a magical fantasy world by someone who has no clue whatsoever how to go about the task.
This is an adaptation that simply doesn't have much of anything that is engaging about it, leading to two hours that end up being more of a slog than the celebration of life and love it should have been.
"What the hell did I just see?" That was my first comment to the studio representative after I screened "Winter's Tale." Allow me to save you two hours. of your life:
One can only hope this story works a lot better on page than on screen.
Unashamedly romantic, it is perhaps a little too convoluted to appeal to the most devoted audience for unashamed romance, the teenage girl.
A fine book fights gallantly to escape from its straitjacket, but eventually lies down and allows itself to be trampled underfoot by bad ideas.
Fails with such absolute sincerity that pointing out its incompetence feels mean-spirited.
For all of its lofty ambitions, A New York Winter's Tale emerges as a hugely disappointing experience.
Findlay narrates in huge chunks of religiose voice-over. "Nothing has been without purpose - nothing," she concludes. Well, perhaps not nothing.
A flaky romantic fantasy that spans three time periods and is eye-wateringly ludicrous in each of them.
A fairy tale concept enlivened with average special effects, a plight predicated upon purportedly epic affection rendered with the most rote and unearned of emotion, and a tale supposedly larger-than-life but lacking in enthusiasm or investment.
This is a film written, produced and directed by the same person, and the lack of perspective shows.
Goldsman clearly doesn't know who he is making this movie for.
With an unbelievable romance, huge leaps in logic and a messy narrative structure, there's little to recommend about this film.
A-list stars and gorgeous photography aside, this is the kind of eye-rolling, fairy tale folly that gives Valentine's Day a bad name. Your sweetheart deserves better.
Unfortunately, the film's magical- realist approach comes off as kitsch and preposterous.
If these actors felt they owed Goldsman a debt, they've paid it in full.
