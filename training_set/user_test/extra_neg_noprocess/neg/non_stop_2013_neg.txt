The problem is that Non-Stop tries to be something it's not. It has one too many scenes that border on ludicrous, and the big reveal barely makes sense.
Never coming to an airline screen near you, 'Non-Stop' is a silly but engaging action movie starring Liam Neeson as Bill Marks, a federal air marshal.
The premise is sure-fire, but director Jaume Collet-Serra's grip on the material is not as tight as the cabin pressure; moments of sentiment and unnecessary back story relieve the claustrophobia and stall the momentum.
The structure here is familiar, with various smaller twists and red herrings eventually leading to a big reveal of the true villain and his motives. In this case, that climax elicits more of a shrug than a gasp.
Rarely as compelling as its premise might've indicated...
Neeson is good but his character in the film is fuzzy and the overall plot makes little sense.
The whole concept to Non-Stop is completely hackneyed and frivolous, but remains compelling given the fast paced, guessing game that ensues.
