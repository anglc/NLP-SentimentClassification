As virtual tourism, it's a success but as dramatic fare it's a distinctly thin bowl of zuppa.
It's nicely performed and reasonably amusing but it's hard to care about the rather self-absorbed characters and their cloistered universe.
Quite possibly the most boring film of 2010.
A disaster area, pure and simple.
