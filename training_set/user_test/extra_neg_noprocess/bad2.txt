You don't need a PhD in History to instantly realize that there are two words in the title that just don't belong together. Blaxploitation offered up some crazy stuff (a bloodsucking brother in Blacula, a huge killer penis in Welcome Home, Brother Charles) but having African-American militants style themselves into urban Nazis is just beyond the, er, pale. The story of Colonel Kojah and his stormtroopers avenging the 'hood against The Man and then succumbing to corruption suffers the usual exploitation-movie problems in the pacing and production departments, but it's just too bizarre to ignore.
