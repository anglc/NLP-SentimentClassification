Made in the Philippines, this spy parody stars Weng Weng, a 2'9" midget, as the kick-ass -- or make that, kick-balls -- agent Double O. A bizarre James Bond riff, over-dubbed by expatriates, the film has him facing off against his nemesis, Mr. Giant, who plans to rule the world with his, er, "N-bomb". Weng Weng followed up with The Impossible Kid, in which he works for Interpol, and made numerous other films, some of which are still being uncovered by cult-movie investigator Andrew Leavold.
