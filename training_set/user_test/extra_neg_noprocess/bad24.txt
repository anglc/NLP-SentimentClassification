This attempt at showing up the seamy underside of the film industry is in itself testament to the overblown excesses of Hollywood before the Easy Riders and Raging Bulls shook things up. But that doesn't mean the story of Frankie Fane, amoral gigolo who claws his way to the top of the A-list, isn't enormously entertaining. Seething, sleazy and sensational, it's consistently guffaw-worthy, not least for Tony Bennett's disastrous performance as Hymie, Fane's version of Entourage's Turtle, and a glittering parade of stars doing cameos as themselves.
