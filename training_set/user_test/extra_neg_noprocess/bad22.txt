You've got to see this one to see what $125m being spent at the rate of a million-a-minute looks like as it's flushed down the can. The confluence of talent, where they'd been and where they'd go, from Arnold Schwarzenegger and George Clooney to director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman, makes this fascinatingly awful. The production values, like some neon-lit theme park, are astoundingly gauche, but that's nothing compared to that script, whose clunky chorus comprises Arnie's clunking out "comically" cold puns as Mr. Freeze.
