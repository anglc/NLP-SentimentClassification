A serious contender for the "worst-worst" movie ever made, Manos is also in the running for "best-worst" because it's defiantly odd and amateur and it achieves a strange, dream-like quality. A lost family is trapped in the realm of the Master, who has a harem of kinda-sorta-vampire wives and a satyr-like minion named Torgo. The production history -- it was made by Harold P. Warren, a Texas fertilizer salesman, as a result of a bet with Oscar-winning screenwriter Stirling Silliphant -- is almost as weirdly fascinating as the movie itself.
